You know what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you read in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather clothes, and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that a epiphany generally is something that fell into a place.
You just have to give the apple back to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school in the middle school, at <unk> Ohio where I was the rare class.
When I went to bleeding every week, every week in the bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the school room.
I was making it in secret.
For three years.
I had to go out of the city.
I had a thumb, 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations that were fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we never get to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've found.
And I must tell you that I've got pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to leave you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it a place, the <unk> and the monitored and <unk> their family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about was made on itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today was a lot about this.
It also needs -- it needs -- it needs to be dignity, love and pleasure.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was trying to understand what I was in front of me.
I put them around <unk> water about 60 feet, and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> about another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall out of glaciers or they break the ice barriers.
Each iceberg have its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with its environment and their experiences.
Some refuse to refuse and hold hold on to the end, while others can't afford it, more and <unk> in a <unk> passion of passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated apart and alone, largely as we see ourselves as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> is going into a <unk> I'm breathing its atmosphere <unk>
As a iceberg melts a iceberg releases fresh water in minerals that feeds so many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was just about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way and will not exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice <unk> I photograph is very <unk> it's a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last picture I'd like to show you is from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually see a <unk> iceberg in it.
Here they are.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an iceberg on the average size iceberg here.
About 120 feet of water about 120 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single baby.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want it to be too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about conception -- they won't pay me attention.
So let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X <unk>
And in the other case, the X <unk> chromosome joins the X chromosome <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity that I will get to two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a training for training, and what I study in this case is the way that people are going to make the anatomy -- the anatomy -- human bodies -- how have the body <unk> the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that I performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working, for example, with twins <unk> two people inside one body.
I've been working with people who are much lower than average <unk>
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physics of physics doesn't fit into male schemes and conventional female systems.
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
The <unk> takes a lot of forms.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't exist in the common form of male or <unk>
For example, there's the case of the individual -- with <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene says to the <unk> that we all have in <unk> life that will be <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, the testes produce testosterone.
But because this individual doesn't react to testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high testosterone levels, but without feedback.
As a consequence, the body develops in a typically female course.
When you ask the baby the baby has a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often it's not about puberty, but until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast and not have the menstrual period when someone realizes that something is happening.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a Y.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it actually isn't.
Women, like men, have in the body called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I think a <unk> woman is not known to be a typical female structure, I think to be a typical woman most of women as I are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me have the most exposed brain to <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing, it's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the way, in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 year-old boy born and raised as <unk> I had girlfriend, and sex with her, I was wearing a life as a boy and just found that I had <unk> and a <unk>
It had an extreme way of a disease called <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the chromosomes and the areolar glands, the areolar glands were so active that in essence, creating a hormone hormone environment.
As a consequence, his genitalia were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was at 19 years when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors found that in fact, was women inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th media chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> -- they have broken tissue, wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know how well that happens.
So, there's a lot of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are <unk> twins <unk> or <unk> <unk> to surgery -- it's not to be able to have a better physical health of physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it's <unk> several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy is bringing together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity, they will be black, he wants to have African anatomy in terms of <unk>
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you're presented with a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very excited ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people inside a body.
The most height case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put his sex on the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called it to ask, "What a test are going to do to determine if <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you journalists who don't have such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't draw a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more it comes to science, more we need to admit that these categories -- we thought were <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories -- are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not only in sex.
It's also in terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the terminology of it.
As we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of the fact that they made a few <unk>
And as we go into science in science, we get more and more in an awkward area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and at the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but within <unk> about when someone is considered killed.
Our ancestors never had to be able to have this question if someone was dead.
As a lot of it would put her up in front of the nose in front of your nose and if it was still not going to be <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs of a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with a dilemma of figuring out what someone's death really is, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories might be happy like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, <unk> to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
I think these categories are much more fragile than we thought we were thinking about.
It comes from the concept point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the Founding <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold, and so radical in what they did, that I find myself every so much looking at that musical <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the Parents <unk>
The Founding <unk> were, to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they were doing, it was a <unk> concept, and I met it with another one that was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And, as everybody remembers it, what our parents are, <unk> was the idea of the <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had a clear idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it was coming into political power by the right of blood being passed from grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
I know the Founding <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it for a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They took the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they're part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> the democracy and at the same time, <unk> science.
And there is very clear, if you look at the story of the Founding <unk> that many people were very interested in science and the idea of a world <unk>
They were <unk> from the mandatory explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to transmit passed through a vague idea of the right idea.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future <unk> movement.
They didn't think about that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement came with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
Again, people of color who are going to match <unk> <unk> about <unk> difference and, again, <unk>
We see the same with the Movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start to ask why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights than a human.
I don't want to say we should be able to anatomy.
I don't want to say that at the age of five, they were supposed to allow sex or to get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me makes sense and I think we should <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings in the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time -- June 1, 1980.
So Henry, on the contrary, was born on the March 1 in March 1980.
For the only fact of being born three months before Mary was attributed to all the rights three months before Mary -- the right to sexual consent -- the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different biological age, but because he was born later.
We find other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Now, Henry, in virtue of being considered man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered to be a <unk> of the compulsory <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, on their part, doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all of the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories that in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science was advanced so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy might <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It looks like what happens in our culture is sort of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people got stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at a certain time has decided that to marry a man doesn't have to have a chromosome, and that to marry a woman has to have the y chromosome.
Now, in practice they don't do tests that are giving people <unk>
But this is also very strange because of the story that I told you about the beginning of <unk> to <unk>
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I <unk> a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin but on the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do people judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this to make sense of rights to people, because I've to admit that I know from some <unk> <unk> that they probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent and smart decisions about their sex relationships than 40 people I know.
So how do I put the issue of the content of <unk>
It's very hard.
And a part of me wonder what would happen if the character of one person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an <unk>
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current current of thinking about democracy.
We have done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to the other men is susceptible to <unk> unless they're willing to stand up to a change of sex, in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who has been talking about a couple years ago that I had made light <unk> so they had to pick them out, and then they <unk> their fame.
But when the phone asked her the operation, it was a very <unk> operation, and he said that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore he had to do it.
I said, "Well, it's considered political <unk> rather than <unk> <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are not <unk> to change the end of the state.
So I think we need to be on your head.
Well, to end I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be like or as it might have been, if we had given greater participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming out of different <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual activity.
And one of the things that has been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with complex social relationships that are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in the feminism <unk> I considered <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has the <unk> of <unk>
And I thought, "This is the most silly question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing feminine in the <unk>
But the more I think about his question, more of me have something like there is something female in the <unk>
I mean, that there might be something on average, something else between the female brain and the male who makes us more <unk> to complex social and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if I know the Founding they were very aware of the way to protect the people in the state, it is possible that there will be more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> support.
And maybe that is what we have to do in the future when we get democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when each family think where it wants to go to live and work, has the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this time we're far from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily take it into the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if they've never thought about new cities.
But we just ran out of the apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments are already owners, and the other half is still not afraid to get it.
They could try to increase the ability to build <unk> in all of the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that are around them have rules to avoid <unk> and the distractions of construction.
So it would be very hard to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a totally new place, build a whole new apartment building completely new, always and when the norms of that place will lead to construction rather than putting it up.
So I proposed that the governments -- new programs of reform in big enough programs to contain cities and gave them a name, cities.
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 people who were going to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> happened by a Chinese constitutional crisis.
In the next presidential election, <unk> <unk> was imposed on a platform in which we <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked him to <unk> her head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk to TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence to users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those norms say that you can't go and assist all of the current residents of apartments.
It will be a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes as much of technologies as well as rules, and they usually are the rules that prevent us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link to the <unk>
I showed you to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a conference room in a hotel room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities are, much more valuable than its cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City, in some cases, it's worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract debate and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk described in very simple terms, which is a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are going down there and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
This airport is only about 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince them that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
The whole world is <unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader approached the platform, and he said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed that <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you could go that could be in <unk> rather than hundreds of kilometers away from the North Pole.
And also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from countries that are associated with them to help them establish and make the norms of the <unk> so that they could all be confident that the <unk> are effectively <unk>
We went and saw one site.
This picture is there.
It could easily be a thousand square miles.
And shortly afterwards, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow these special development regions.
In a country that I had just passed through this crisis -- the voting on Congress in favor of this constitutional <unk> went to one.
All of the parties, all the <unk> in society, <unk>
To <unk> in the 1950s you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed again in another voting on <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting on <unk> in February, a <unk> to about 30 <unk> was at the two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new <unk> city center that is building in Korea in Korea is bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years to get the <unk>
The other interested country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've been built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this very practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a second town.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and once would allow to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the last court court for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and builders that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you've already solved is they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to go into the <unk> especially in a place with a free zone, and there's a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change anywhere else.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go to get a job, sometimes they're mothers who have to earn the money to just eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it look like to think about insist for families to choose between many cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my <unk> friends asked me to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what is inside, I'm going to make a confession -- and it's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, wear, and more recently recently photograph and publish in my blog, colorful and colorful and different <unk>
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> shops.
Oh, thank you.
<unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I go to know people <unk> -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> and my aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search staff.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
I'm going to like color <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are <unk> then I feel that I won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what we would call for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you bring with someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I sell.
I've brought seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
On the inside for a week it's all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I would like to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me like the woman who walks at TED in underwear,  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the <unk> for this week.
Doesn't it sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure not using new clothing.
Let's start with the Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost see a phenomenal thing for less than 50 dollars.
All the whole, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be out of <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, not just you're going to get away from you, too.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're wearing in.
Sometimes people tell me it seems to play the <unk> or I remember their little <unk>
I like <unk> and saying, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you see you well with something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think you don't look well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, you don't look that you can't get <unk>
So there is no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth -- six words for you: The gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching me this week, just what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to give it all.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave the back of certain things.
I don't need to be emotionally <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there is a little love in my heart and I go ahead.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So, if you take a scale to measure the <unk> <unk> we could design a plane of our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some of them are <unk> by one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people -- that the same as most of the other quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play things.
We put them to play with them, and then we see as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As intuition that you may have developed with the step of the years is that one thing can be only in one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy and it didn't do it very well, it always <unk>
But I bet the playing with that parking bar taught him a valuable lesson, and it is that big things don't allow the <unk> and to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they don't play with parking bars -- they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years ago; you needed from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the large objects that surround us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it's not very often doing with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason they shouldn't be.
And so I would feel so much better if I could somehow show that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to broaden it a little bit a little bit. It's just at the center.
And then here we do a very large approach, the little <unk> of metal.
And what we see is a little bit of metal <unk> with a springboard and a springboard <unk> on a platform.
And so I did this almost as a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip, again, and I put all the great machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a swimming swimming device, which is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for that needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable, it is to be on a elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up, you get out of doing those things, because I don't want them to get them, or in reality, you know.
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The classmates of inanimate objects are not only people, it's also light that goes on and the wind that goes on and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to be <unk> according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, and then we get a <unk> and pulled it up all the air, and then you put it down at a temperature of less than a degree at the absolute zero at all.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little metal piece is free to act like you.
So we measured their movements.
We found that they moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way it <unk> it was like a breath of this way -- like a <unk> it expands and <unk>
And by giving it a <unk> thrust, we were able to make it <unk> and don't go at the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
We think about atoms.
In an case, all of the trillions of metal that make up that metal piece are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down the bottom.
It's just <unk> when those <unk>
In the rest of the time you're <unk>
It wants to say that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, watch this, the difference at a scale between one atom and that little metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little piece of metal and you.
So if one single single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why won't you too?
I mean, it's my logic that I talk about.
So imagine if they were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we put it up, and we turned the lights on, and we looked inside the box, we saw that metal was still there in a piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects in the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just putting it into a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And so 18 months ago, I was doing another job in Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss that's here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and it took me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, we were going to do it with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is just explains just on this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I was born of a great education -- not <unk> but I had no access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to do the desire to do more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do it.
So better that shows the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've been conducted from his launch.
So let's go back to you.
Look around all the museums there.
There's the gallery <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I actually go into one of my favorite <unk> the art of New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and click on, we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move over there and you get <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We open the plane, and with one click, we jumped into it.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall, right?
continue to go ahead and go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here is all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, -- I think, about 10,000 billion pixels.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really do with 10,000 billion pixels.
It can zoom in around very simple.
You see things that are going on.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to do it.
So I started playing, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems to be <unk>
I walked into and discovered that the children were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a pole <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even further into depth and you'll see that you can actually get even to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take away the picture, so you'll actually see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, one second.
So now we're quickly going to jump back again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It goes up and actually <unk> it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen it before.
I'll show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot of things over here, but I don't have any time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor or if you have a <unk> that day.
You can actually create their own museum, create your own collection from all of these images.
It's very simple, you walk in, I've created this function that I call <unk> <unk> -- we just put around around it.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things back to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel like you look at these masterpieces ...
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even of the museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope in this digital media to make justice in art and that is represented on online online.
And the big question that they ask me today is you can do this to replicate the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening.
I have something to show you.
Think of a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab, we call it cognitive design.
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, <unk> all the kids in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened very interesting in the careers of Formula 1 in the last two decades.
So some time ago, if you wanted to win a hundred school, one, I took a budget and you would take it into a good pilot and you fold it into a good pilot.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you gained the career.
This is what it is, in engineering, it will become real control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming <unk> computers in the air.
And as <unk> are starting to answer differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a side note wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the crust of the planet but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the late summer.
It's called <unk> Uncle <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms to become sensors and <unk>
And that is changing completely the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end of it he took the hammer and he threw it in the Moses -- he still can see a little <unk> <unk> and he said screaming, <unk> non <unk> -- and what didn't you <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just some <unk> insisting on the idea of taking the environment and push something out.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of you remember it, they played Italy and Italy and France, and at the end of the day, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
At the evening early there are people here and doing <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> of France.
<unk> people do a call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She earns Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk> at the center.
You see the big summit.
The next day everyone went to the center of the British team and the prime minister at the last minister of time.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> people are going to be <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way we could not have done a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume.
Today, we know everything about the input of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how does it <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed a few small tags to track the trash in its shift by the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago, to tag what they were -- different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are going to be <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the trash -- and then we started <unk>
These are the results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there is a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening complicated things and there's a lot of transport.
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that <unk> it doesn't leave in some place on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we <unk> a day still stays there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some behavior change.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detecting and lots of cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the beginning, which is push over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of the water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology can be the new technology, the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a garage, was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves from <unk> valves who open up and <unk>
It was created as a curtain <unk> with water <unk>
If you go on the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, like you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
I liked it a lot.
And we had a commission to design the building into the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There are no doors or windows, but when you come up to it opens up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there is a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all architecture disappears, like in this case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter when you go down the roof, somebody who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it's low all the architecture disappears.
This is how it works.
Do you see people <unk> what happens inside.
And here I'm myself trying not to be able to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children in <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was going to open to let it happen, but a building that was still running down and holes of water and one had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because of engineers, designers, we always think of how people give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that you could have small helicopters in the air and that each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw earlier, that moves with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal -- but in three dimensions, where what changes is the light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appear in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D <unk> that you can get closer and forth and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light turns out, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them being controlled by a person.
We can have every pixel with a input that comes from people, and so on, etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of people's <unk> in New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their movement in 3D and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so much <unk> in real time like motion.
It can take all the movement.
You can go all the way around.
And once we have the pixels -- we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our inner environment as a <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of them fit a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is going to do, we can move from the digital world -- the power of the <unk> of the <unk> to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people feel involved in doing this together together.
The cloud is a cloud, which is made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered from the pixel here.
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from below, it will serve to share the main moments of the London Olympics.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can rise, like a new <unk>
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than that <unk>
Suppose I told you that, with only a few changes in their genes, they could improve it by a more accurate <unk> more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in a better way, to be stronger -- having more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure of ourselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What are you going to tell you most.
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How much people do you choose creativity?
Hands up, let me see.
<unk> I probably owe the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many people would choose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something like this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference -- but I want to give you the look at a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Catholic Church -- <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense except for the light of <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution to consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
Does it mean the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end is, of course, the most interest to us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of you have gone and <unk>
We've been here a few years old.
It might seem like we're far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the human insulin protein that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it is the same protein, chemically <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in the larger gut that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> are asked by the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully seductive environment for those bacteria.
It's warm warm -- it's very <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that they can want to want no effort to their part.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush rush to the output.
But so we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients from <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what are we telling us the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, the life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and unique and unique human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I was just <unk> I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the organisms -- every cell just <unk> and all the genetic energy in that cell is transmitted to the two <unk> cells.
But when multicellular organisms appear to change.
It goes into the scene in sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens to the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, one might say that the <unk> of the death of the body enters evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still exist in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits her door door <unk>
He opens the door.
In front of it is a little bit of a <unk> <unk>
He looks at it and says, <unk> in search for a <unk> <unk>
"Okay, he said, George, I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
He wanted us to be healthy.
I wanted to reclaim health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is to move the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic load into the next level, and then let us drop the sea.
I think we all <unk> the feeling that Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve the immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> I don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily serve longevity.
They don't necessarily serve the bigger or the stronger or the faster and even the smartest one.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, <unk> fish in empty, yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this, when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we look at what is happening in the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> stage, I would say that there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the kind of thinking that I thought would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and separated from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that we adapt to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we have <unk> and we were so excited that it's no longer possible to have the amount of isolation so that evolution happened.
A second possibility is that there's an evolution of the natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we <unk> as distant planets are going to exist to isolation and the environmental changes that can produce evolution.
But there's a third possibility -- an intriguing possibility -- intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in the choices that we have <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
So first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing more male than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what is <unk> and family level.
Think also that if it could be possible to be able to choose not only from their <unk> but in their own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating it.
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> million dollars.
And the next year to be finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a complete sequence of the three billion bases of the human genome at a cost near about 20,000 and a week.
It's not a lot of good for the human genome to actually make the human genome for <unk> and to be more and more and closer to all.
They come to those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect ourselves but they are going to induce immunity.
And there's no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine with the flu flu cells in cells from a <unk> plant.
Can you imagine something nice to go out of the <unk>
That's actually today and in the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then just other two <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies, but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newly <unk> egg and give her children a better chance for a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, remove the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also have to take a better memory.
Why not have the <unk> of a Ken <unk> especially if you were able to deal with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a faster <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer.
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions of passing this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to become the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happens within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren from their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these choices for a better society, more successful, more <unk> society.
Or, we are going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do is, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only thing that I could talk to the flight satellites.
So immediately I looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already cracked the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
Let's take the engines.
Imagine being on an airplane and not <unk>
And then he said three words.
The most <unk> words I'd heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. It was terror.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned it all changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before she died, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought all of the people I wanted to do in life, and I didn't know all the fences that I wanted to reach out all the experiences that I wanted to have and have never been <unk>
As I was thinking about that later on, I came up with a phrase, which is, <unk> wines ...
Because if the guy is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing that day I learned that day -- and this is as I put up the George Washington bridge, which was not a lot -- I thought about, Whoa! I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and with my mistakes.
But in my humanity also gave me place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I would do with things that don't mind with people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy in my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to be <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mind watch is <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And as I grew up, I had a sense of, Wow, it will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to love it. I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
One month later, I was in an art performance -- first grade, not much artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a little kid.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point I understood those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle -- not to die that day.
And they gave me a gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and go back to live differently.
You who are flying around today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens in your airplane -- and therefore it's not like that -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is it that they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents that we could get.
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with a lot of projects.
But the greatest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk>
One day came to her home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has a total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design company and an animation, so obviously, the graffiti is that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
And so we decided we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just I want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate to me."
And I said, "A second, I said, "A second, you don't see Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be important and you have a safe insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way -- they get marking with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I came up with just a wish to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I joined her brother and his father there at that very moment, "All right, this is David Tony going to talk about, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has both on their inner cannot <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> which have a technology that allows you to project light on any surface and then with a laser pointer you draw over that and record negative space.
So they're going around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They start with sex organs then with bad words, then with the Bush words, they start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much to move the things on one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, I match the gates of the insurance companies, and we got a machine to make it <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's about the <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy -- you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers around the world <unk> from every corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved into the garage back and these hackers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they <unk> would have taken the frames from the walls and instead there would be <unk>
But for two weeks -- we went to the <unk> walk and my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> and you can see the <unk>
These are a couple of low-cost <unk> that we bought in the shipping wall of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a <unk> camera -- we put it on a <unk> light, we put it on a <unk> light, and now there's a device that is free -- and -- we published the source code, the software goes down for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says "No."
There's no hospital that can say "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we came back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a planning year two weeks of planning, I had a very intense sessions in all night, Tony come back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall from the outside hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what it was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent to us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I draw in seven years.
I felt like I would have been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and take me out of there so that I could make it out.
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device, but it's the equivalent of a Blank.
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained lots of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The awards were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then in December, Time magazine recognized as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010, and it was really cool.
So the best thing about this -- and this is what ends up about closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> <unk> in the middle of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> it's going to have the best <unk> in the urban art -- <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show, which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that isn't possible, do possible.
Nothing that is in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I was never a programmer, I did nothing with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something and let me have wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you all to do every single day when we find ourselves with something that we feel like to do.
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years ago in situations very hard situations and at the same time a little dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in areas of <unk> hard and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just a fun thing at first, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career, I've been dealing with the only goal of <unk> to the only goal to deal with social issues in ways that we have to make interesting attractive, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that they see entertaining and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I got a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you don't have any idea what it is and according to content it could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridicule you or your company do it.
But saying this, it's a very good chance.
Do you know how much people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you'd have been asked a year ago I hadn't been able to <unk> for certainty.
But in the new film I'm working, we look at the marketing world of advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've put myself in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be done -- nothing could do it for something that hard or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that treating the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film would be <unk> with products, marketing and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The biggest film ever <unk> is that all of the top on the bottom -- it has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title, <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all of this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> I just got it. It was more for <unk>
It was <unk> forever."
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X brand in the title, but we're going to make sure of <unk> all the categories that we can on the film.
Maybe they would give a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe that you have.
The most cool car that you've ever led to "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink that you have <unk> <unk> of "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, they make them <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> -- and we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the shot -- all the shot from beginning to end.
And I would love to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> people will be.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it's going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half a half <unk> Very quickly: John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to go to the meeting with them, but it certainly is worth convincing a couple of big events.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment the film is going to look like a lot of <unk> idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most responses will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard for the film or to be I?
JK:
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
And so on. I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation with a microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one for one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product as many people as possible, to make as many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today, this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the media scenario is not the idea of that new vehicle worthy of attention, it's going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image is.
See, when you look for <unk> images in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that came up.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey Brin: No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily detected or access to information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line, perhaps the bigger problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president, even the <unk> even <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it actually changes very suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency <unk> -- like that weird bear that still keeps <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell them that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want to be <unk> history.
We want to make a story, but we want to make it a story, but we want to make it <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and there is him looking at it, like <unk> said, "Son, there are three sides in history.
There's your story, it's my story, and there's the story <unk>
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, I would have to take away the proxy and go to the companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to show up is -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking with the businesses the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, big, giant movies, and others that make small, independent films, like mine.
And my friends who make films of big Hollywood <unk> they say that the reason their movies have so much success is due to the associated brands they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can tell you "Are you well cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you to help you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there he would offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as to <unk> solid, <unk> <unk> at <unk>
That's the overall picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at it.
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
Let's get the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: higher technology.
MS: <unk> is not the way you want to describe something that you get in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think it's a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do we keep them fresh time? We get better <unk> three times a <unk>
Things like those that <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a company <unk>
What about me? What about a common kind of type.
I need to talk to the guy in the street, the people like me, <unk> <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do they define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good <unk>
Woman: The 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is it <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of colors in the dark colors, lots of grey and things like this.
They're usually wearing them as a sunglasses, or I like the crystals and the like.
Woman: If Dan was a brand brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part <unk> in part <unk> in part <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because you get rid of it.
Man 5: Go! <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I am <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand Tom, but I often get stuck at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could enter my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they could do it for them, they probably could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world that you want, like people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come out and start in a place and in my case come out and start in my family in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about?
MS: Next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like things different.
I like weird stuff. I like that weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> for what is it for us?
What's the <unk> What phase is that you find right now?
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid.
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience, <unk> Great <unk> Yes. Thank you very much.) Very good.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
I was really crazy about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but <unk> in your personality of <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only going into one of their strong ones or on the other time to focus on both.
Many companies tend to avoid the things that are not <unk> avoid the things that are not <unk> avoid fear, those elements and you actually give you a little <unk> and you make them become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are like this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can see also here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful marks and brands -- those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to make your brand, your brand, your brand, your brand, what would that be?
You're a representative attribute -- you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather an <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be playful as the contemporary art, and <unk> <unk> or bold as a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical like <unk>
Or are you rather than attribute <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated like <unk>
Are you established, traditional <unk> <unk> you with <unk>
You are <unk> stable, familiar, safe, <unk> <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film of how the MRI are used to identify the centers of the desire in the brain as long as for marketing for commercial marketing as to film.
We went to San Paulo where they've been forbidden outdoors,
In all the city over the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where businesses are getting on their way in schools with money problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that projects in which I've had the greatest response or the ones that I've sought to interact with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took off their agencies, and they said, maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to treat it directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that will make people think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how did he gone? Did they succeed?
Well, since the movie was sent into the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> and no press and TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost every rating agencies that we talk about will tell their customers not to be a part.
I have always believed that if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get people out of that you're pushing them to failure.
I think when you trains their employees in loss of risk, it's preparing their company to reward <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people that are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we will go, I think we need to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Now more than ever a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all of my <unk> <unk> the <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name on <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So we put it on behalf of transparency, which happened exactly those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED matrix, the Foundation Foundation a check for <unk> to be applied to my own TED year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are systems in real time.
If we can engage these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes do not use software software, they're a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a cash virus out of Windows in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, so we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows <unk>
<unk> comes into the gray box, damages <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started looking at <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> and these control systems.
So that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment in which we had our <unk> environment, and we saw what happened to this.
So they had very odd things.
<unk> <unk> like a laboratory in lab that he didn't like our <unk> the wave, but he didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And after experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is looking at the gray box in the gray box, if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that place: it's actually working on that scenario.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because <unk> "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It could be, let's say, for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
We'd better take the goal soon.
And so we pulled out of the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two bombs -- a little bit and a big one.
We also saw that they were very armed armed with people who obviously had all the internal information.
We will get all the points to attack.
They probably even know how much we went back the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, and from high-tech and <unk> let me tell you the load is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code code.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning were called functions in the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and tried to deal with the real world with potential potential goals in the world.
We need theories about recipients that we could pass or <unk>
To get to the theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it has to be a <unk> white <unk> and it's probably where most infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants among our <unk>
And I called them and I asked them in an effort to take their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that piece of mobile inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious way to go crazy to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> by looking at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> are <unk> in that code, you can't afford it.
I started researching scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall has <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> at 15 parts called stages.
And guess what do we find in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in my hands.
It wasn't like this.
The results have been that after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> on dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> were to one single thing, but from different perspectives.
<unk> small is taking a <unk> and doing <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicate with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're really confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We need not to worry about other targets for <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw, I really enjoyed me.
There's the gray box, and up there is the <unk>
What this thing does is intercept the values of input from sensors for example, of the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors, which provides <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, this false input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators in the room of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital safety systems where a human operator couldn't act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the big steam turbine is going on speed, you have to open HIV valves.
Obviously, this can't do this a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can explode.
And the <unk> nor the security system is <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could also work too, for example, in a power plant, or a factory plant.
It's <unk>
And you have no <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms for <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, what you're going to do is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We have to face the consequences and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides that people assumes that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the reverse superpower here.
There is one only, and that's the United States, <unk> <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give <unk> skills or other than making chairs from wheelchair will come up and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that goes in in the morning, gives you a great force that is also increasing its speed, and help you, for example, handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connected with the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now in what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back a 45 pounds, and it's going to become even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications <unk> injuries on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage <unk>
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk> Human Human Human <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can spend 90 pounds per variables for many hours.
Their flexible design allows for <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back now to go back to the wheelchair chairs on what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people -- roughly, of wheels around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation here.
We talk about something that happens often very young people with damage to the spinal cord than when their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that are <unk> which is moving quickly.
His only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been like this for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I have to recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago had an injury in the neocortical column.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> which <unk>
It has some sensors.
It's completely not <unk> on crutches that send signals to the onboard computer here on the back.
There's also a few batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and at the knees, and they do it progress with this <unk> very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a strange jump in the air, skiing down the bottom <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all sensation and all movement from <unk>
Shortly later, a doctor walked into my room at the hospital, and he said, "You're never going to be <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last moment of hope for me.
The technology of adapting since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs down the <unk> and even mount <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the <unk> and we sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations, not just without soldiers, but to Amanda, and all of the users of the wheels, to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I've just come back from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, they know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos in Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimps, their closest living lives.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this aspect of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by big, <unk> society, Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where the death violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the jungle <unk> and it's been very hard to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage that has sustained for decades, and caused almost so many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put in danger of the Bonobo.
The trade trade and deforestation is that you can't fill in a stadium or a stadium with the Bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the <unk> hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like the apes <unk> the love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, like humans, love playing throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
And for us and the game is fundamental to create bonds and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game the Bonobo sees the root roots you same as the dance and the human ritual, dance.
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of only unique videos of the wild videos.
First, it's a <unk> ball, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what she is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "I have <unk>
I just think that in this case, he love, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because it shows this video that's really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like the <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is a young female -- a young female who is playing with fresh water.
I think that like her, sometimes we play themselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that propelled us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future that we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But do you get to the maximum capacity of the game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and human, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems to be the least appropriate to play, they can be the most urgent moments as it is.
So I have primates, to accept this gift of evolution and play together as they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers would miss.
I remember my first fire fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a career on foot against other volunteers to reach the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that has certainly <unk> one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- came up to the captain and he asked her to go out and save the dog owner of his owner house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, for the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a call to be alive just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get between the house.
I need to be able to <unk> the fire, and bring this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I went on the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire firemen -- that height had been finished to shut down the fire and entered the main room in pursuit of a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house in the house for your home owner where, as I would expect, his trove got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the house owner of the owner of <unk> by the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she watched on the other was that somebody had had a couple of shoes.
Both on my calling for Robin <unk> like in my calling as a firefighter I'm witnessing the acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look in this room to people who have achieved, or are there remarkable levels of success would like to remind you of this: Not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, it will be now.
They were eating food in a dining room, a neighborhood.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So they enter <unk> <unk> shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of a particular block.
The first concrete blocks made in <unk> with a very simple idea of concrete modules from a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the building blocks came to every home.
It's estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 building per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> did it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete block, the favorite in the world, and turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a <unk> <unk> world stacked to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to create a lot bigger and more complex circuits a brick at a time.
But there is a <unk> difference, the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't think that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
Let me show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each one with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motor and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they link through magnets.
So you can't get it in a wrong way.
<unk> have a colored code.
The green is the road, the blue is the stream, the pink and the orange color is the wire and the orange color.
So you only have to assemble a blue one with green and very quickly, you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue one with green is making light.
We can put a button in the environment, so we have a <unk>
If we can change the button by a salad module that's here, and now we have a light <unk>
We took this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk> gestures in it.
To make it faster or slower, you just run this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection growing.
We want all the interactions in the world to become ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar cells, <unk> <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given the children to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand electronics from every day that you can't learn in schools.
For example, how does a night light works or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without some electronics in electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  So a few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of Rhode Island School of Island to have any experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, Do you something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is made from the darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics turned into another material.
And we want this material to be at all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk about discoveries.
I work in the solar industry.
And my little company is looking for getting involved in the environment focusing on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to push the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology.
Oh, this is what time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technical people to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we're supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a few Peace <unk>
We took some members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to Third World -- we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> They worked with <unk>
Your task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I would find a quote, but what really looks for is that somebody else has to clean up on the snow because he knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help from this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time we spent a lot last year.
Did you realize that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that the citizens would be <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
In doing so, you put a name, in this case in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can <unk>
So does it have a players' uprising.
It's a modest application.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 applications -- <unk> last year.
But does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it goes viral.
One responsible for <unk> city systems looking at this application realized that I could use it not for snow, but so that citizens have <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work with these <unk> of tsunami, but people <unk>
So this is why he asks the citizens that <unk> them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens of the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks up when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we use using it.
And this has been <unk> without organic and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology will know that this doesn't happen yet.
The software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they made the normal channels it would have taken at least two and over two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the California justice power that even the moment 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there's projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that has been program in a couple of days -- and it spreads in viral shape is kind of a shot of warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests the government for better ways to work, not as in private companies, like many people think it should be.
It also wasn't like a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way to deal with the issue of government that has new <unk> not as a problem of <unk> institution but as a collective action problem.
And that's really good because it turns out we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools that they were building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people in the country that contribute to <unk> applications, every day in their own communities.
It's not given up with government.
Do you feel a great frustration before that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings of politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that put us crazy -- the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> what we do together because they're alone not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you're one of those people, I would ask you to do it because things are changing.
Politics don't <unk> government itself.
And because the ultimately <unk> government -- you remember that <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly about <unk>
This is the center of health care and information.
It's the place that calls the calls if you mark <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He joined the official knowledge base.
I found nothing. He started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put hard music and see if it <unk>
And it works. So well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a <unk> and a mobile phone, called <unk> <unk>
We don't get that app.
It was the work of very smart people at the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened is this <unk> <unk> in my trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
<unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so you can all see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I approached the place, and I found the cube of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, <unk> <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of government to commit distributed collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government like platform.
And I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform so that people will join and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected to two people.
And it could have been connected to the government services of being necessary and the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than government services.
When your neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call control control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people are going to do, but think that one is the entrance to the other.
Our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen to a political <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will transform our values and make our needs but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word, with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> which holds us that is that it belongs to us that we founded as something that is working on our against, that other thing, and in a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work we'll have to make bureaucracy that it is sexy.
Because that's where the real job of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens worried that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk> activism.
And for those of us who have <unk> in front of the government, it's time that we ask, what world do we want to leave our children.
You have to see the enormous challenges that they will have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't care about government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's one generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> we only have to articulate the systems of the right way.
The age of age of members of our members is 28 years old, so I -- to <unk> I'm a larger generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that all of us face about who is going to talk to you, they're all going to talk about.
They can express their views on any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the problem with the government that they don't care about to do hear their voices.
They're using your hands.
They lay out the work to program the work that will work better to government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking out <unk> taking a bucket of garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we are not only consumers -- we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that; we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody here, when it comes to the important things we have to do together, all of us together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons in death row.
I've spent most of my life in communities in communities and places and places where there is a lot of desperation.
And I'm going to be here at TED and hearing these stimulus has given a lot of energy.
One of the things that I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact all over the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk>
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in practice, practice my work.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in all of the discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was small and I looked at her, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then get stuck with me.
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said it was not going to get me back and tell me that yes, I was allowed to peace.
I had this human quality that I would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture your time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
So I looked at her and <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 -- 20 minutes, she got up, went down through the room, and he took my hand up, and he said, "Come on. The two are we going to <unk>
I remember this as if it were yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me out and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell <unk>
I said, "That's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I didn't have a <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "Just I want you to tell me three things: <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "I first want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> like this, <unk>
Then he said, "I second I want you to tell me, is that you will always make the right thing even though the right thing is, even the right thing is.
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
Then, finally he said, "I third that I want you to love me?"
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> this thing <unk>
I grew up in the field, in rural South, I have a brother older and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where <unk> grabbed my sister and I went to the forest.
We just got the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, he gave my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> and you always do the same thing that we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I don't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens to you? Take a <unk>
I went on the look at the force and <unk> "Oh, it's not going to be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tell everyone grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this to think that it's a <unk> I mean by the power of the identity.
When we created the right kind of identity, we say things to others that really doesn't make sense.
We can't get them to do things that they don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother would naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to her, we had to get it back.
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today, there are 2.3 million.
In America, we have the largest incarceration rate of <unk>
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, or poor communities, it's so much <unk> so much despair.
One of three black men between the 18 and 30 years is in jail or <unk>
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Washington, by 50 to 60 percent of all young people are in jail or a parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a court system that is a lot better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that affects the results of the results.
And it looks like we feel very <unk>
The fear policy and anger make us believe that these are not a problem with us.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some of the things that are well.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you care about if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of black male population has definitely lost the right to the vote.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before you get the law law to the vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world that was given to <unk> to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for kids, without the possibility of leaving myself.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've got to think that the ultimate question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death penalty in the United States is defined by error.
Of every nine people <unk> has been identified that it's innocent who is <unk> and liberated from death row.
A rate of error, <unk> an innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation would not be allowed to ever fly airplanes if in every nine you'd have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on <unk> <unk> I talk about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until the Second World War.
We really don't know much about this.
But for American Americans in this country, it was a defined time by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
I was worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what they defined their lives.
Now there are more people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach talks, <unk> <unk> people to stop saying that in our history, cope for the first time with the terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was obviously in the age of <unk> and decades of modern <unk> and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we had to do with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage them with a really process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany, and I was taking talks about death <unk>
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's very disturbing to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> "We don't have death penalty in Germany.
We will never be here."
The room was silent and a lady who said, "No way in our history, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> and <unk> we could run the people."
So let's move on this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, would teach people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnect.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you really don't care about these issues, the positive and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are made by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
I've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more <unk> with the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, those who never come to TED.
Think of them is, in some ways, something that's inside of us.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so afraid of the intellectual thing.
With creativity -- development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also by the <unk>
This connection to your heart is what drives us to look at not just how bright and <unk> but also the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for the spirit, an will for being in despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, it must be <unk>
There's no disconnect with the technology and the design, that allows us to truly be humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, we would encourage inequality, to inequality, to inequality, it will be truly human.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women would get together simply to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> was called me to say, <unk> comes Mrs. <unk> We're going to get together to talk.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "I do."
Then she would say, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk> <unk>
So I was going to go and just <unk> them.
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks led me to me and said, "Now, my <unk> Talk to me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed for.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave her all my best speech and at the end of me and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> out very <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> put my finger on the face and said, "That's why you have to be very much but very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated on simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is higher than the worst we've ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody is taking something that doesn't belong to, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills another one, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in the people that should be <unk> by the law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and, surely, in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> you don't judge ourselves by our technology, for our designs, or for our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not because of the way they deal with the rich and powerful rich, but in the way as they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make a lot too much force.
<unk> tired, like everybody.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my <unk> clients and 14 years that have been <unk> so that they were taught as adults are <unk>
And I start to think, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to someone who is not it?
The judge would recognize it as an adult, but I see a child.
One night too late I was awake in <unk> by God, if the judge can turn it into something you don't are, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think properly, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a 14 year-old customer -- a <unk> black <unk>
I started to work on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> black customer being treated as a privileged old <unk> <unk> of a <unk>
In <unk> I had been <unk> conduct in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there is no ethical ethic but a whole lack of ethics.
At the next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, I had not only <unk> it had sent it to the cut.
It took about two months, I had forgotten.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case, stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally dropped out of the car.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black black man -- was the <unk> of the court.
When I saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "I'm <unk> I said yes.
And so I walked up and I was hooked.
And I would get on the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That's deeply connected with my interior, with my identity that we all have to contribute to the community with a sense of hope.
Well, I went to <unk>
As I came in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, my <unk>
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
The cops got the policemen <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people, and I was talking about races, because we're talking about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I turned to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look at the window and try to hear all that <unk>
I'm walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black man, with concern, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge would judge a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> was upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk>
And the old black man stood up and looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this audience audience to tell this young man who keeps his view on the goal with <unk>
I've come here today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we cannot truly be human, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is connected to each other.
What our visions of technology and design, entertainment and creativity must lead to the <unk> of <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Let's try to hear and see a clear <unk> desire for the audience, in this community, to help you do something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There's a number of opportunities close to you.
If you live in the state of California, there's going to be a <unk> this spring in which is going to be an effort to make the funds that are spent today in policy policies.
For example, in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases are not <unk> in <unk>
The rapes don't get to anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are <unk> to make the law at safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it is said to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say that you think about that?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
Great growth in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in <unk> population.
And we let ourselves convince them for punishment.
We have three legal causes to lead people to supply chain for stealing a bicycle, per small crimes of <unk> rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've been excited about today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
Announcer: <unk> the threats by Bin Laden's death.
<unk> #2: <unk> in Somalia. <unk> the police throw O.C. <unk>

Several <unk> War, massive <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Egypt.
<unk> Death <unk>
Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> might be the last six days or over the last six days.
The idea is that the press media would be <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to you.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are receiving many, many more data than probably the brain can be made.
And as nothing matters to us more than survive, the first stop all the data is an ancient piece of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a <unk> stories to look at the negative.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there is blood -- it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us bad news, the seven days of week, 24 hours a day, is no wonder that we're <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong.
But maybe not.
Maybe what really happens is that we get <unk>
Maybe progress tremendous progress in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the computer extinction -- the scarcity of water and <unk> <unk>
As human beings are very good at dealing with the problems, and in the long run, we just had them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> average per capita income adjusted for inflation has become <unk> throughout the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, from the electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that the world's literacy spent over 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're actually living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to get more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, large part of the people who live under the line of poverty have electricity, no water, bathrooms <unk> mobile phone, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> the <unk> of the past century, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It was a lot of this technology and then lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that you can put in information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and it's doubling the price performance for about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that has in your pocket is a million times cheaper than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First, the soft thing is -- in good and bad times -- in the war and <unk> in recession in depression and <unk>
It's the resulting computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> on a law on the left, they curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly fast.
And in this curve, to <unk> on Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call artificial computing, sensors and networks, the robotics, 3D printing and <unk> the robotics, 3D printing and <unk> all over the planet, synthetic biology, fuel fuels and food, digital medicine, <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" from <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline that they were doing.
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> who was trying to create.
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
Play with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for every single cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can now impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> it's about creating a life of how possible.
It's about taking that that is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
He went to dinner the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with covered in silver, and the same <unk> with <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington State is aluminum.
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like <unk>
It's tied to oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came out, and he made the aluminum thing as cheap as it was <unk>
<unk> this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a <unk> planet, for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about abuse, it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the late decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have plenty of water.
Let's talk about wars for water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after <unk>
<unk> a famous picture, how do you get <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet's planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent per water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> of the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology that's available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a refrigerator size.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water on the day of any <unk> saltwater, water <unk> by less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just noticed that I will do a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out, and I have full confidence that this is so that it will be, Coca-Cola will implement it in the world -- countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation by this technology that has today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that mighty warrior has better mobile phone communication in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell you with a smart smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton spent 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance and communications that nobody could have happened.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid for dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video and video libraries of books and music, technology technology, <unk> technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes to get the health applications in the way.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which was called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies on a mobile device that they speak, and because it has <unk> you can extract blood from your finger.
To win has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the payload charges is 25 percent and there are health workers.
When this device is <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that wouldn't be able to call the <unk> and first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion increasing.
The white lines here are the population.
We just had a brand of 7 billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give to the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it will go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds before it gets to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What do you do? What kind of <unk>
And instead of economic collapse we have the biggest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> from more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Academy <unk> and because of the use of impressions and 3D computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
What if we give the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What about these 3,000 billion?
And if they're contributions we can't afford them.
One thing that I learned with the X <unk> is that small, guided by their passion with a clear goal can do things that were going to do things that were previously able to do things that could only make the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end with sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and the functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played this university teachers among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it has shown that today, the pattern of human patterns is better folding than best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are going to be concerned about to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very scary idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You may think that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is on the Red Cross of <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets still said they keep <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept the waist.
Because I was there at <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, some <unk>
There were <unk> about 20 percent, the <unk> <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was so abundant and it was in a good moment, so he was getting more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped in half.
I went to the five centimeters.
It was a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 19th century, it started in the <unk> Europe had a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was to impose to the countries that already had 100,000 Chinese <unk> fishing fishing.
And this boat is pretty ugly, I called <unk> 4.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the South Sea of China <unk> and, above all, in the Ross Sea.
What we captured it was something <unk>
<unk> now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are on the bottom.
And most of the fish are tiny spots on a few <unk> remains that are a coral reef fish.
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study -- and then commercial fishing begins.
The bottom line is going to be a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to do it because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen are collected every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But it's not <unk>
We don't remember.
<unk> the start to start on the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have things that are consumer biodiversity, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the accumulation of changes.
And at the end of the end, I keep on <unk> remains.
And that, at a big measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they are no longer -- or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies have to kill us and kill animals without knowing what they've done to few generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose normal animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous sea of big fish.
They become unlikely because they <unk> them.
With the time there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, is not the way they would expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as a few <unk> like captain just looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or, usually they don't use the coal scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, although we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on sources of the past.
Out of the enormous paper that can be a marine marine zone.
Because with the marine protected areas, we really actually <unk> the past.
So let's look at the past that people can't conceive of, because the starting point has run and it's extremely low.
That's for people who can see a protected marine area, and they can benefit from vision that they can erase out their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they have no access, they have the <unk> people in the West, for example?
I think there is the arts and cinema maybe you can fill in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay of <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales gray whales on <unk> Bay.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and the <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were really moved with the film, they were going to talk about the story of <unk> why would we do with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing to give, it's to be able to do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager of YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are made up with a viral and what matters has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger -- that seemed something very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper notoriety in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
You get over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of the percentage is getting a lot of a <unk> getting lots and lots of visits and a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: Three things: <unk> communities of participation and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video filmed outside his house in the National Park of <unk>
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This chart shows <unk> in the rise of popular summer.
<unk> didn't say to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this question that I would play the video of the <unk>
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> are presented with new and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday, Friday. You have to go on Friday. You have to go on Friday. The weekend.   Everyone wants to go on on Friday. On Friday.  KA: Don't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
A Black Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day on Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science from <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke on the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that a person or a group of trends embrace a point of view, and they share it with a more broad audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this great intern on internal then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon <unk> or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an undergraduate animation with a <unk> music.
That's it.
This year, you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there is a three-year-old version of three million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet Internet community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an version of the old one.
And then it became international.
All of a sudden, arose a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something we can all form part.
Because today it's not just <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or RS: Black or <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written by this situation?
In a world where two days of video goes up two days a minute, only the truly unique and unexpected can be made by the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who was protest against <unk> in New York, I'm going to admit that I wasn't interested in.
Casey <unk> <unk> me for not the <unk> but often there are obstacles that get you rid of circular with the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise effect and his humor, Casey <unk> made five million saw and understand his idea.
That's why this approach is true for everything again that we make in creative form.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> of trend, creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are features of a new type of media, which we all have access to and is the audience that defines very popular.
As I said earlier, one of the <unk> of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
I didn't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owner of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, it's just the current means of current media, but we will understand the entertainment entertainment.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been completely in vain.
The words, for so much time my friends, now I am."
It will be <unk>
He died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a young marriage died, and two little girls.
For her, life was meant to be a <unk> task for her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> who defies fiction, a boat was treated in the sea dressed in <unk>
All adults knew about risk.
The biggest fear were <unk> the rape and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother had a <unk> poison.
If we got older, we first would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not to be able to break for six hours.
But I know the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, the journey was too much to get it; and the first apple that I hoped for the men of the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, they were in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations, giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is comprised of immigrants from immigration.
Unlike the suburbs of middle-class class, whose existence I <unk> in <unk> no sense of the right.
The smells that came from stores were from the rest of the world.
And the words of English English fragments that people had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked on farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days of turn.
And yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, they wouldn't mind what it should be <unk> that it generally was <unk> it was always <unk>
Two pairs of middle for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform to <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there was <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, what?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we got <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother's home.
My mother had a <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be awake until its nightmares were up to be able to make it out.
She opened a computer store, then studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition angry and angry boys and boys who are trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they were created centers.
I lived in worlds.
In one, it was the <unk> <unk> brilliant student with what <unk> of myself.
On the other, it was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and <unk>
But many of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer elected the young Australian young year.
And I was a piece of one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges are not <unk>
So <unk> <unk> resident was now so <unk> refugee and social activist who was invited to talk about sites I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence I could never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire on the routines. and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending up the day for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of every single day and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age that she had when we climb into the boat.
The "no" never had been an option.
<unk> he said, "What do you not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking about it more to talk to you.
I met people of all the roads in life, a lot of them doing what they were doing, living on the edge of the possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
There was another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a new step, new in the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that is grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> it can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave them enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world will be <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> they wouldn't have been <unk> they were a tremendously.
There was a power there, a optimism <unk> a mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a small group of people who the motto cannot be <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I made a giant <unk> of soup that everyone <unk>
It takes a good time at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant ones, and we opened up.
It took the decision to move to the U.S.
after one journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
First of all, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of her husband, caused a <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause her itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
It can't prove it to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the <unk> hotel room when she died, she was <unk> miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw him stop on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell him stories and make sure that we were still with it.
At night a <unk> came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
"You haven't been <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through the women.
Given who we were and how life is built to us, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have been easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I ask myself about the boat.
Who could that wish for this?
But I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a <unk> <unk> in every wave, the constant pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see it, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of so today, in the fourth or a fifth line.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the time of the ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and drop the sky.
Now we do it with airplane.
At that time when they were born, the great Prince of the Indian warrior -- it was <unk> it was pulled out of an arc of a bow to the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And I got a lot of fun with that.
Every time I felt a little bit more about <unk>
I had this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that the technology had to allow magic, not <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of <unk> <unk> was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones and luxury clocks and cameras prevent them from <unk>
We celebrate our inspiration.
So I was able to get rid of this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books since 16 years old.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a <unk> device able to connect the readers in the entire world.
You can know how to take the book, you know?
Where we are.
<unk> text with the image of the image, animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what is it for that?
I'm about to launch an interactive application for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so ...  he says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back to a character from the book.
In a number of moments, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where it's alive because of GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl gets excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but at that magic of childhood, those ideas that we were using children.
For some reason, fireflies are always turned out so exciting.
So over here, we need to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, they light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy.
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I move into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In the entire book, there have always been maps but it's been static.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you through the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book you have also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another hugely important aspect to me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people were out of India know their counterparts -- the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra over the millennia, in an old <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child story.
It's in a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can get our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to reclaim this ritual of childhood you have to go out and go out and on a chapter, a picture of a flower and then <unk>
On another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
And so it creates a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that have been taking.
In the ways of connecting between magic, the Earth and the technology is a lot of possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on it and through it is augmented and using augmented reality, you see a group of <unk> cartoons that appear on the inside plants in the house.
At a moment the screen is filled with leaves.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where the forces of nature are linked with technology and magic and technology come to each other.
It monitors power power.
We are close to our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic, joy and love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of <unk> <unk> projects.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University of <unk> was led to a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she stood up a little cup of coffee or tea and asked the patients, family and <unk> what <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems that all of us or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail to listen to.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's very simple.
It has a <unk> and down there.
Every morning I <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I get <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor in <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time in which it needs <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you get up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
Over the week next week.
This little <unk> is connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were taking care of their homes, to take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to reclaim the control and to be captains of its own <unk> but it can also help care of health because of the challenges that we face, like the shot of the costs of attention, <unk> <unk> and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share with you with a video video.
We all have navigation controls in <unk>
Maybe we even have them on our phones.
We know where <unk> ATMs in <unk>
And where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find low-cost food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives at this time.
What we did was we do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public public, and you see a <unk> please see <unk> where, when it's open, because they also open up in the middle of the office and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks use your cellphone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I want to introduce you this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also like <unk>
And we want to take it globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find work and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
They could be messaging or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in place.
Please take me into this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're photographs that they can't take with their cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed up with my earlier passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because by using the camera and the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera -- the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography was more than seeing with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
It's like this: a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And, despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful <unk> but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way like photography.
<unk> where you will have to think of a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capture an idea that has to capture a moment.
But what's the trick that makes you seem <unk>
They're the details or the <unk>
<unk> the light?
What does the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but of what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here are three perfectly <unk> objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But in some way you can create something that seems to be <unk> as if you were there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So, <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like a realistic picture of those in which they don't even recognize the things that are around us in our daily lives.
But by combining photographs is very important <unk> because otherwise something is going wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the photos are <unk> they must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet with these <unk> were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the principle and end of the different images with a perfect piece.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
So you might think this is a picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of pictures of different places.
The personal thing I think is easier to create a place that will find it because you don't need to put the ideas on the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a pump of stone.
And yes, I even made the house house on the top of the island to get more <unk>
So to make a realistic result I think it takes planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures it can be very beautiful, and at a very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide on a very boring technology.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from my folder, mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the general side.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus power of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, like many other people we usually see, is a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with curves with <unk> that's something new.
Here's something strange here.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please switch on the lights.
It was more intensity because writing on paper.
Why do we make technology <unk> technology on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw to draw a normal curve in which you say, these are the years or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to give you the diagram would look like something ridiculous.
That would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you say, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very silly, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transport technology as fast as the <unk> <unk> we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go down to that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development, that every few years advance an orders of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- to look at these <unk> curves we see that they don't go forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
We had one of two things.
Or do you be able to turn into a typical curve, I know like something completely different, or maybe I'm going to do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
If so, we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and I ask myself, is, what is that new way that takes the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we are engaged in it.
I remember the future happened in the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future remains the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been spent year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that's going on.
And we can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it all will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to tell you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at the long term.
The time scale I would like to do is this time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So you go back about a couple of two billion years ago when the Earth was a big rock <unk> with a lot of chemicals that are going around around them.
If we look at the way that those chemicals were organized by those chemicals we give us a sense of how things came from.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, it had floating some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplet held a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring materials out of the outside and the droplets grew up there.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms -- those <unk> of oil.
But those droplets were not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time they were <unk> they would give a distribution of chemicals that were <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow became better at the time of bringing the chemicals in the time to incorporate the chemical <unk> more chemicals and become more <unk>
Mostly they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, and life -- very simple, but things get interesting when these droplets learned the trick of abstraction.
In some ways we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information that was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this hopeless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since evolved 2.5 billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, the same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I did just for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> white dust that I try to hide the security security security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and fold it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
So the DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happily be happy another billion years.
But then there was another big step interesting in which things got very different and was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way we avoid penicillin and they were <unk> to create their small DNA with other bacteria, and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that in a way, they were together in that way, and established a <unk>
And so <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals of that community -- more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities came to so much that, in fact, they come together and decided to write all the recipe for the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities that have communities -- communities of many different cells working together like a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that no longer act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve the heart of the heart, or the brain or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the appliances that process the information that those cell communities built in.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community as responsible for <unk> to understand and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system in those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruits because I knew bad and got sick the last time that ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit there.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures enormously completely <unk>
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals found the trick of communication.
So, for example, the most <unk> version of this is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea in your head.
I'm sitting here emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a kind of vague idea, <unk> and <unk> in his heads that holds some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated and convert it into sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work like a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've begun to do <unk>
We now move through the similar periods to the <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods and information processing.
So for example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the <unk> the video tape -- the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us together in something much bigger and faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the program <unk> to our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of history I told you about led to a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
Over the language, they took less than a million years.
And beyond, like electronics, it seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess it <unk> is the right word to name something that determines its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent computer advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to teach ourselves in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor does in that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with <unk> designers we think about an abstraction level, we put it in the machine and the machine that does something that you could not get, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we use methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method I've been using recently, is evolution itself.
So we put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions from instructions to <unk>
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all of those programs, and take those who are more connected to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to imagine numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequence of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But once luckily, it was able to find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that did the <unk>
They put those and <unk> the rest.
And now we are going to get better than the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children would take the properties of both programs.
So we get a new generation of programs from the combinations of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's move back again.
There are some mutations there.
And it tries new and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that would make numbers so much perfect.
In fact, they are a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to go through them to see how they work.
They are dark programs, strange stuff.
But do they meet the <unk>
In fact, I have the security of the target because they come from a hundreds of thousands of programs that succeeded.
In fact, their lives are dependent on this.
Once I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> <unk> doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they're being <unk>
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce a lot more complex things than normal engineering does.
We don't understand all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make a lot faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
That means <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at a moment analogous to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think we are all part of the creation of what is to come on.
But now comes lunch and I think stop here before I got out.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time for me to give up some of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, this is approaching the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> the <unk> talks about statistics and to use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm focusing on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means the <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and anyone who tried to take care of the first base, not coming to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how you call a <unk> of 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how you call a baseball baseball <unk>
That is by the way, that is somebody from 10 <unk> to hit four.
<unk> like legendary Williams, the last player of the Women's League <unk> in running a regular season or a regular season.
Now I take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable -- or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'll tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're <unk> to a surgeon who has also a record for 400 in <unk>
That's not working, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a dear to be wanted to have two clogged arteries and their family doctor derived from a cardiologist whose record record is 200 <unk>
But do you know what?
She is remarkably remarkably this year.
And its hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask:
What do you think should be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon, or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk>
And so good.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or <unk>
What we do, however, is sending them to the world, and I include myself in the mandate of being perfect.
I never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a obsessional obsessional <unk>
Once, a fellow in the high school said that Brian studied until a blood test.
Such it.
<unk> in my little <unk> in my nurses at the General General Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my way of anatomy, <unk> the origin and <unk> <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the frequent <unk> diagnostic diagnosis and not standard.
And I even knew the differential diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as we get more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the school school with the impression that if you were to take everything, then I would know everything, or as possible as possible, because I'm going to tell you about mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here in Toronto, when they brought the lady in the emergency service service where I worked.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when emergency room was going to go back to a cardiologist -- I was going to go into that patient.
And I report to the chief of <unk>
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I read it, I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which gave me a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops going to work and, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I went to work on the treatment that I read him.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on their heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that it could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I sat very well.
And it was when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more errors.
I emailed her home without talking to the head of <unk>
I didn't raised the phone, I didn't have what I should have done, I would call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that is constantly going to pursue care.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even standing on my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they send her home, he didn't take attention to a voice in my inside that he would say, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so confident that until I asked the nurse that I told the woman who gave the lady <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to your <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said with total <unk> "Yes, I think it's okay.
I remember that as if it were yesterday.
So he was writing high, and the ambulance next with the ambulance <unk> took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, I had a bad <unk> in your stomach.
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I was going to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking parking lot where my car was in order to go home. At that time I did something I don't do normally, I did something I don't do normally, I did something I don't normally do.
I went through the emergency room service home.
And there is another nurse, not that I heard of the lady <unk> before, but another one, he said three words, those three words that most emergency doctors have been <unk>
Other specialists fear them too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: you remember you?
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, she <unk> the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and forth on the verge of death.
In an hour of an hour of getting to her house, after I gave her the high school, she was a collapse and her family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> with a high blood pressure of <unk> which means a severe shock of it.
I'm just breathing and blue.
<unk> personnel all its resources.
They gave her medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk> artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the spinal cord.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and waiting against every hope that he would be saved.
And in the two or three days the next few days it was clear that they never had.
He had permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it would be moved to what was happening.
And the ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. wife, and a grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of the ones that die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks -- I was obsessed with that and experienced for the first time, shame that exists in our medical culture and I sat alone, without feeling that healthy shame is because you can't touch it with your colleagues.
You make peace and never more makes that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
Shame <unk> that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that meant that.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would take things out and made sure that I didn't care about.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why was he sent her home?
And in my worst <unk> "Why did I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose <unk>
Little to little that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And on one day <unk> was opened up, and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if you were to take the efforts to be perfect to do not make any more mistakes, it would be ordered by those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it turned out.
Two years later, I was an <unk> in the emergency room in a community hospital in northern Toronto, and I got a man of 25 years with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her throat, I was a little <unk>
I was beaten up penicillin and sent him home.
But while he ran to the door was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my journey on guard, my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I made these three words: you remember you?
You remember the patient who saw a pain in <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, it's an infection, not the throat, but on the top, it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He's not killed.
<unk> antibiotics is <unk> and it recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a big effort, particularly working in a hospital, because they were <unk> 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
<unk> an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out, a colleague who was checking some sensitivity to the bottom lower quadrant, and called a surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read the liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk> it.
I checked it to when I saw some sensitivity in the bottom right, I called a surgeon.
Both of them were operated and recovered well.
But every single case, I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and like many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been over the last five years.
They are embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't have and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what's really going on, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do you teach this for not to make the same <unk>
If I could go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg, believe it would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of <unk>
It's the system where there are two <unk> who make mistakes that are going to do, and the ones that don't sleep and the ones that have <unk> outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, as antibodies that start attacking that person.
We have the idea that if you bring out of medicine to people who make mistakes are going to be a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism I've done a personal PR study and mistakes in order to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the Toronto of the <unk> to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where mistakes happen every day in which one out of 10 medications. drugs in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right -- in a system where infection <unk> are increasingly <unk> and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, 20,000 Canadian die of medical errors.
The U.S. Institute of Medicine established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we are not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is divided every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest chest pain comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with <unk> and all of a sudden, my story was trying to contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this stuff, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get together, and we eliminate all the professionals who are likely to error, well, it's not going to be anyone.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, <unk> art.
And their students were <unk> they would go down the head and put it up and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
They were able to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
<unk> doctor is human, he knows human, accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to try to learn from what happened to teach others.
It takes their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving and supporting support for everybody to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans run the system, and when this happens, they become mistakes once in a while.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I am human, I would make mistakes in it.
And I feel so much but try to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
Recently, I did a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to pick a half American American -- are about 70 a day.
It doesn't do a long time, in a research followed by a week to a group of presidents for companies.
The researchers recorded all the different <unk> by these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> jobs per week.
Now naturally, every job included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about their choices.
Do you know how many belong to the <unk> category and how many of the <unk>
How are the way that the way that they are driving those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems that we have to choose to the overload of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and of some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When you ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
In other ways, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, are you ready to hear about the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, this very, very <unk> supermarket at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the water <unk> and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that shop, but on one occasion, I asked myself, why never buy anything?
This is a shelf on the oil oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> box trees that were coming out of the trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed to me with the buses full of tourists that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of classes.
It was a post for <unk> right at the tent.
We put out of six <unk> or six flavors -- and we saw two things: First, what case people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when I had spent a mile that when I had only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
When I stopped when there were only three percent of us to buy <unk>
What stood up when there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
So if we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we probably have a good <unk> to keep <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices are affecting us very well.
We decided not to decide, even when this doesn't get us.
Now the issue of day, the financial savings is.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in which we see the decisions about savings for about a million Americans, in between 650 plans from this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funds available to savings plans for retirement plans for retirement plans to save people save for the future.
And we found that there was actually a <unk>
We had plans that went from two to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the number of funds, there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in those plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans to offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation came to the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger the number of options, more people would be committed to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As soon as there was more options, they were more willing to invest in financial financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three key negative consequences to the more and more possibilities.
It's more likely to make the decision, even when it goes against their self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
You're more likely to pick things more likely to pick things less than a little less <unk> even though anything, you get better.
The main reason is that we are going to look at that huge variety of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, to contrast and choose that stunning <unk>
Today I want to take you four simple techniques that we have in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in your businesses.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than more.
People always bother when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But what we're seeing is more and more of what we're looking at is that if you decide to cut, get rid of <unk> options, and there will be an increased sales increase, and the costs will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> did just eliminated the products to stop cats that less <unk> increased <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and under costs.
You know that supermarket <unk> today, they offer 45,000 products.
In a tent that's offered about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world now is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind tomato sauce on it.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to manage the choices is the wedding by David <unk> the Harvard program.
All of the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a insurance background.
The people who really want to choose, is they offer them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
They already know people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They all are <unk> options.
The first thing I do is to ask <unk> <unk> the differences that there are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they won't be able to do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience on a holiday on a holiday on the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
They want it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to prove to you, and then I want you to give you a round of applause if you're ready to take the supply <unk>
<unk> <unk> All right. Anyone who's ready to accept the supply.
They're not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually hit hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first trial, that in the two, but I can tell you that the second time was more real.
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the <unk> problem that is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must be feeling very much <unk>
Why is people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use credit or credit cards than when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real.
It turns out that it would be more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to learn more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> staff who were working on <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were brought into a <unk> plan.
At that meeting that we were in exactly as <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that we would love the staff who would think of the positive things that they would invest in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or in what they wanted to place on their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study we did in a magazine room.
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> along the death row, the display of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> <unk> OK.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know something?
This scheme <unk> is completely useless.
<unk> must tell you something <unk> not that the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funding.
I'm supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if I just hated it a little bit.
We have to increase complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision -- they buy a car.
This is a car manufacturer that allows us to completely <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
I have 56 color outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box box -- four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order in which decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from many options, 56 colors, just about four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go of a few options, four <unk> by 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to do?"
So how do you are.
If you put the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from a lot of other choices to do -- we have a default button and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they keep there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order in which information happens.
If we start with the easy thing, you learn to <unk>
Even though we pick the box of changes not to say anything about the preferences of <unk> in all forms of ways you're going to choose to choose.
We get excited about a product that we're building that we now have more sensitive to the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> to get rid of alternative alternatives -- we can make it <unk> -- we can handle more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented are designed to help manage <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who are going to work.
I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful the <unk>
And the more careful time we are in our choices better we can practice art art.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> in the East Germany <unk> if you had a typewriter it had a <unk> machine.
And I had to record a <unk> text leaf with the machine.
And this is so that the government could track the origin of texts.
If they found a writing on the wrong message, they could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, how much this is <unk> the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, if you buy a laser color of any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having some yellow yellow dots on every page that you follow a pattern that makes you yourself on your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be very much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
They're <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the <unk> to make a lot of money, huge amounts of some.
There are really many cases on the online line, <unk> <unk> who would give money to their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means by illegal means by illegal means by illegal means by selling money from our accounts when we buy our keys or steal our <unk> to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The U.S. secret service two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this tells you had a <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say today you're more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong.
In the future, most of the crimes are <unk>
The second group of <unk> in importance we observed today is not motivated by money.
There is another thing that moves, motivate them, the protests motivate them to motivate them, motivate them to motivate them.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a major role in the online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> criminals are criminals who do it for money, <unk> like Anonymous that do it for protest and the last group is the United States and the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of the government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands, or actually it was.
<unk> the bottom last fall because of a <unk>
It was the safety of the site and perpetrated a <unk>
And last week, I asked a meeting with Japanese government representatives asked one of the leaders if <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a heart attack.
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do they serve the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, services like <unk>
Except that we had a foreign official authority.
And that the <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in Arab Spring, and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, Egypt in Egypt -- the headquarters in the headquarters for the Egyptian secret police in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes of a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to <unk> the communications of the citizens of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 35,000 euros to the U.S. government.
The company is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools for governments to be able to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, found <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspected of a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But now it's more there.
The connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these things like this obvious answer should be, "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do we <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's on a game of privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we would spend today, will be forever.
Do you see blindly <unk> in any administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the south part of Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows of my dad at the bottom, and behind the cows, the editor of Nairobi.
The National Park of Nairobi has no fences over the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed by night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and found it very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up <unk> a lot to lions.
They were dying of the warriors who protect our community and won, and they're also mad with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the Nairobi.
A child in my community, for six to nine years old, is responsible for livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought lions was scared.
But I realized that I actually didn't know this, because they even help male lions see the pen <unk>
I don't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
It was trying to trick lions so they believed that I was near <unk>
But lions are very smart.  They came up the first day and saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing doesn't move. It's always here.  So it jumped and they killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions didn't come back.
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that which will turn on and off the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk> <unk>
It takes everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the small box -- I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights out.
As you can see, the <unk> give out the outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how they see the lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions so that you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And neighborhood houses, you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals that were lions and asked me if I could put the lights out.
I said yes.
You can see it, you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
I've been installed in seven homes in my community, and they're serving a lot of a lot.
And my idea is also used for all Kenya, <unk> other predators like vertebrates and they're also using them to get elephants in their farms.
And thank you for this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, Medical School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funding and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a child in the grasslands, from the <unk> cows from my father, and I used to see planes planes and told me that someday would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving cows from my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture what exciting is to listen to a story like yours.
So you've got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electric inventions today.
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close to electric <unk> One near <unk>
<unk> I know you already invented electric fences -- but I want to make my own.
CA: So, you know, a little bit of it at a time, right? And I've tried that -- I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: Al <unk> Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to take it on every single step that I have a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a small one, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we will spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that the Americas, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Although sometimes I was asking me about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea, until everything was suddenly changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister from my sister.
That said, "When we did this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks of the family.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
I was very altered.
It was the first time I heard the people were suffering in my country.
At the time I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
One woman without life was dead, in the street, holding a child in his arms watching his arms looking at her mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine left outside North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and just few they survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more frequent <unk> all around me was completely dark at night except for the lights in China, just across the river from my house.
I always asked me why they had light and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea picture at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the river River, which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many of them die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating on the river, in times.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only tell you that during the famine years, I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as a refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not only hard, but dangerous, because the refugees North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear of my identity that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destiny in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was done when I was arrested in the Chinese police and I was arrested at the police station.
And somebody had been accused of being <unk> then I would give my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me many questions.
It was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But he managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer said to another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum.
But many of them can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though there were <unk> had eventually released after one harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they are <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to escape a lot of other Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of the world can be done in a second.
This is why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to go to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much bigger challenge than I expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start to learn my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even through a identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call for <unk>
Though I went to the life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
North Korea authorities had a little bit of money that sent my family, and as blame, my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location outside the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to engage in some sense, for over 3,000 miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took one week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and approached by a Chinese police officer.
He asked asking all of us questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese -- I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official came up to my family, she stood up and told me that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe the guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated to cross the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But while time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital capital.
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close to him, but my family was <unk> in prison to a short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to go between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man said, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would be asking to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I gave him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and another two North Koreans and <unk>
I would love him with all my heart, and I said, "Why would I get <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village to <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown unknown of a new hope for me and for the people to go to the town that they were going to be aware of it.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the <unk> people needs.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea.
But getting their freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice language practices, of work, and more.
We can also act like a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue to contact with family members still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans a chance to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Southern <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> shops for fast, <unk>
So the planners of the city came together and they thought, we're going to change the name of South <unk> so that it represents something else, so they changed it to Western Los Angeles as if this happens, what is actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles --  <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans live in a desert desert -- Los Angeles Center, home to food places to take and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that the food places to bring more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles and the South.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I would stop seeing this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go home you see the effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I saw wheelchair chairs and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I also got tired of how to run 45 minutes and go back to buy an apple that doesn't have <unk>
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters x three feet.
The point is, that belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it now.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this was how I decided to keep it now.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we get together and we started planting our food forest trees -- you know, you know, nine full vegetables ...
What we do is we are a kind of paid paid <unk> made by gardeners of all the city and completely volunteer, and all we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then somebody gets <unk>
The city went on to me, and I just <unk> a <unk> saying that I had to remove my backyard, the <unk> made order.
And I said, "Come on, right?
One order a court of planting food in a piece of land that nobody <unk>  So I was like, "Well, I am."
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. was written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition on <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
L.A. is the U.S. city with more <unk>
It has <unk> <unk>
That's 20 Central <unk>
That's a space for planting trillions of <unk> plants.
Why on Earth does not look like this?
We have a plant to give a thousand, 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar a dollar would give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for the South <unk>
I grew up there, <unk> my children there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
Just like an artist <unk> artist <unk> walls, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You'll be able to see what the earth can do, if you leave your canvas.
You just can't imagine how astonishing it is a <unk> and how does it affect the people.
What happened?
I'm witnessing how my garden became a tool for education in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They would stop seeing how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my garden, and I went out and looked very <unk>
I, I felt badly that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt about shame that I was so close to me with hungry, and this is just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, "We don't temes people go to steal your <unk>
I say, "For God no, I don't have a fear that you go to <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to get it, but at the time, I want you to get her <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a homeless shelter in the middle of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared their stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant with her mom and his grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so it was just just for a moment.
That's how Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a few of us had, like about 50 people coming in, work and <unk> every volunteer.
If kids are growing <unk> the kids eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you don't teach how food affects your mind your mind and your body, eat blind to what you put in front of.
I see young people who want to work, but you have this thing in which you're stuck. I see color kids that are on this path designed for them, that they don't take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are getting away from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington D.C.
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans -- this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block from gardens, where people can share food at the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into <unk>
I don't get stuck.
I'm not talking about free stuff because the free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people out of people, pull kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and their honor to grow their own food, by opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners of <unk>
We have to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Is it going to take your <unk> take your <unk>
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to sit on me -- I'm not called you if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
strong. Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me in which this is a very close road.
It's made from <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as it rains too much.
You can have a large amount of water in the asphalt that we have <unk>
And especially if you're sitting on your bike, and these cars go down, that's not very nice.
In addition, the asphalt can be a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, far close to the cities, would we want a road on a silent road.
The solution for that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has got pores and water can go through it, so all of the rain water flows into the sides and you have a road that it's easy to drive, and we don't get water again.
Noise also disappear.
Because it's very <unk> all the noise disappear, so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at that road the rocks of the surface <unk>
First of all, and then many more and more and more, and so on, and so on, and so on, and I won't do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also bring more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can really see how the damage is in this material.
It's an asphalt asphalt as I said, so only has a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> it will be <unk> and if they <unk> they will become <unk> and they will <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool wool from that to clean up <unk> and we can cut <unk> steel wool in tiny, small chunks, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel wool on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one that you see here, you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel -- it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones are attached back to the surface.
Today I used a microwave <unk> because I can't bring the great machine back here to the stage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the sample, that now I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tested a lot of samples there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So they gave us a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> <unk> where we had to do a lane of trial to test this material.
So that's what we did there, you see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the ones then with our <unk> machine and the course, and we went back to it.
We can do this a lot of times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using fiber fibers bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even you can double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they are curious about whether it worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool cool before I can show you what the repair is.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News on his little gray.
I had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those time, because the news generally <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
I would never forget.
True school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban ran out of Afghanistan and they made the girls who were to school.
For the next five years, I would teach me as a child for <unk> my older sister who couldn't just be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two we could do it.
Every day, we were going to take a different route so that nobody could suspect where they are.
We had to hide the books in market bags so that they would look shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us live in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we would build our lives, our students and our students and our parents.
Instead, the school suddenly suddenly suddenly suddenly had a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it is?
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province in Afghanistan. It was that their daughter, my mother, outside the school, and so his father would <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is her.
It took two years ago, just to turn our home in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in receiving education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the <unk>
For him, there was a better risk in not to educate his children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated about our life and was always scared and not see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter of mine, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can help your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So you don't want to <unk>
Today I have 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than high school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself here proud to graduate in <unk> education.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from her home for the courage of educate her daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He doesn't just get rid of my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I wear it on the streets in Kabul.
My family believed in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's why <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls going to school.
The exciting thing is I see the students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I look at their parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, despite the face of a opposition opposition.
Like <unk> it's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than one month ago, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to her village, and they literally sat away from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, a voice had caught him that if I kept sending her daughter to school, they would come back to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've given to realize, and this is something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they are the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school have been told by <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of change.
And we would argue that these changes didn't last much, after the retirement of American troops in America.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents that I <unk> for them, I see a future <unk> and lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day, the girls of <unk> will tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
never, I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent nearly two years since the revolution broke inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution as well as <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a big revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> the fall of the regime, then <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a courage to deal with the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the East <unk> to the west up to the south.
Finally, after a six months of a brutal war and about 50,000 dead losses -- we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a load of load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> out of the devastation and the challenges, I've loved with a lot of other women, to rebuild civil society, <unk> an inclusive transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation
It was about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> almost 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm that I began to organize workshops on the development of capacity, and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women, we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, leaders, very <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and our right of our right to participate in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period -- an environment that was increasingly <unk> that was <unk> from selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was meant and successful.
The women won an American Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and ancient <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of murder of the murder of the American ambassador, and the attack on <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of army officers in the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and his signature abuse of the human rights rapes and their lack of law.
Our society, made up a revolutionary mindset, and it becomes more away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, social justice, we had the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the cones of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all of us at all, with our story of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm more here today to say that we, as nation, we chose evil, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list of <unk> and <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation and reconciliation and reconciliation and <unk>
No, they didn't.
So what happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> for men as for women?
Perhaps what was missing is not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than what it needed to the election -- that only <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the feminine thing to need the <unk> and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call them a few days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, not only <unk> but also putting choices instead of <unk> <unk> collaboration in place of competition, inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> in the war, desperately needs to be desperately in order to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about <unk> and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to be able to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions of the <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and the <unk> that spans the whole humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all peoples have been <unk>
And so like the uterus -- just like the uterus completely covers the <unk> that grows inside the divine matrix of compassion -- the entire existence.
So this is what was like, "My <unk> <unk> all <unk>
This is what this is like, "My mercy <unk> about my <unk>
That we are all told the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a bold question that has an equal answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that you all make a good shot, why is it left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, not an expert on domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I had been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York by my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I creates my alma mater, my head hit my head with a <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap. <unk> of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at Harvard Business <unk>
I've spent the most part of my career working for companies, <unk> <unk> between them -- and they were Johnson & Johnson, <unk> and The Washington D.C.
I've been about 20 years married to my second husband, and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all religions, all of all religions, all of the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> or said in the families, the last place where we would want or we would expect to find <unk> for which, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would sit with a man who hits him, and I actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
He was 22 years old, and in the United States and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be domestic violence victims, that of other ages, and more than 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands on the United States.
I was also a typical <unk> because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signal or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and November night of January.
I was sitting next to me at the subway in New York and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first was that he had just <unk> a college of a <unk> <unk> and he worked in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most about that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field of the field.
I had some big <unk> like apples, and one hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things he did was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it especially on the beginning of a <unk>
We started getting out and loved all of me -- that I had gone to Harvard, I had gone to Harvard, I would put a passion to help girls teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman had ever done it.
And it was why <unk> in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go out of New York, and I thought I'd been doing my dreams, but I thought I had to do it for your mate, so I left my job and <unk> and I went out of Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering a head in a physical trap. financial and psychological psychological
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we move to New England you know, that place is supposed to be so safe to buy three <unk>
One had a <unk> of the car.
Another one kept underneath the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he lived small.
I needed them to feel secure.
But these guns were actually a message to me and, although I'd never lifted up my hand, my life was already serious <unk> every minute of every day.
The first physical attack was five days before our wedding.
It was seven o'clock in the morning, and I still had put the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises had disappeared, I put my mother from my mother and married with him.
In spite of what had happened, I was sure that we were living happy forever, because I loved her and he was like, and he wanted to get a lot of it.
And it was very, very <unk>
It had just felt very <unk> for the wedding, and for the fact of being a family with me.
It was a isolated accident, and I never had any harm.
I spent twice as much as our <unk> moon.
The first time I was driving to a secret beach and <unk> me and he gave me so hard in the head that I would spend several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, I driving our moon of honey, get <unk> by the traffic and threw me a Big Mac <unk>
<unk> followed by one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or harassing at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
So back to my question, why would I get <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man in love and was the only person in the world who could help us <unk> to tackle their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have gone anywhere.
So for me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do because we were the victims, because we were -- we know something that you are usually <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence occur after the victim has finally reached the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to become married, and from financial resources from financial resources, and family court system for <unk> the victim and their children, who normally are forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who was beating their mother.
And yet we keep asking why it's not just going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> beating that beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed it if he had allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the whole world, to the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family, and I am here today because all of you.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as a headlines -- <unk> women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
<unk> for some people is a way to say, "The fault is <unk> as if the <unk> victims intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> who learned a lesson from what happened to them, and they would save their lives joyful and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free lives of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence very typical in domestic violence.
I became marrying a cute man and cute man and we have these three kids.
I have that black <unk> and I have this <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to you is ever a <unk> pistol pointing at my head in the hands of someone who says I want.
At this moment, you are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> -- how stupid <unk> but all this time I actually have been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people, the ones that are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they're <unk> themselves.
The abuse might be affecting their daughter, her sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love -- particular love breaking the silence.
And I continue to do it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk to what you've heard here.
<unk> abuse only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They would take the abuse of the light, talking about it with their kids, their friends and family and family.
<unk> their view of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
And we would take the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show victims a safe <unk>
Together we can turn our beds, and our tables and our families in the <unk> safe <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years.
And I feel like at this moment there's a <unk> tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed you like that.  Luckily, I brought him clothes to <unk>
This is the first set of clothing on a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> you don't have to <unk> now, but I'll find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about myself just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> less than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to spend this sweater through your head, because it's when you're going to laugh for me, so don't do anything while I cover your head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I have totally changed what they thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and a photographer said to me that I would hold my back and get the hair out of the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan like the one that I made two days ago for work, there is very little to be able to transform our looks, which, even though shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white, and in my labor sector, that's going to be a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm a <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, over the last centuries we have not only defined the beauty as and youth and youth and symmetry that we're biologically programmed to <unk> we've also been associated with a high and <unk> shape and shape and a white skin.
And that is my heritage of heritage that I've known to take to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing themselves <unk> and maybe there's some <unk> that <unk> Stop. There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for how much models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York, I was telling each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, just <unk> -- I mean, less than four percent, they were not white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't get away from that.
But then, what I would tell each of these girls is this: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you'd be the first.
If after this <unk> <unk> still <unk> No, no, photograph, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> chief of American journal or the executive executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you be larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate to you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you run your studies, and you have a merit and a little bit of jobs on your back, no matter what you're going to do, I mean, if you wanted to be president of the United States -- but your usual test Model Model sheet for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people always ask me is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture I was born, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know that we're entering the personal domain, but it was a child.
This is what he looks like with my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
They are a bunch of professional professionals, which are <unk> photographers and photographers and all their <unk> and people and <unk> and get this to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is, do things for free?
I have too many inches from 20 inches and that would never use, except the <unk> but the privileges I get are the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> got a light light bulb and, of course, we were <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent of being able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege for my way, not because I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for how they are.
I live in New York, and last year of the past year, of teenagers who were <unk> and 86 percent were black and Latino men, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino young men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times do I get <unk>
When I research this talk, I found out that by 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number takes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the most bright hair, you'll feel very happy and I am.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe I would get it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to go, and also incredible power to work with creative and clever and passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I've never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I am because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask, with a little bit thinner legs and the most brilliant hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs and clothes more to fashion but are probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to retain this talk, I hope everyone will feel more comfortable by recognizing the power of the image in the perception of success and failure.
Thank you.
Now, photography has been my passion since it was the biggest enough to hold up a camera, but I want to share with you 15 pictures -- I was going to have my 15 pictures -- and I didn't go to me who the <unk>
There was no <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a little bit more care in lighting.
In fact, most of them gave them tourists tourists would random.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and five.
He just happened that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said, why don't you take <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue to go <unk>
So here is when we started asking tourists that were going to get us out of them.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never denied and, fortunately, no one has taken off the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became a sacred thing for us.
This is a picture of a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of concrete or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week in October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how it perceives and interacts with everything.
And that particular time that we spent together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of the trips -- we were walking, when suddenly he stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the <unk> store that you would call from small visits earlier.
And he described me what had felt like the five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created is memories.
So, I want to share the idea of engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I am always the one that takes the picture.
I want to encourage you all in the picture, and I didn't go on to come up with somebody and ask him, and ask us this picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most famous birds of birds.
First, why are they so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughs as <unk> silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> and laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with the Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't get clean the environment.  <unk> are not helping prevent <unk>
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better as presence.
There's the <unk> in the New World -- there are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species in these 16, 11 people face a high risk of extinction.
So why is it important? First of all, they provide vital health services <unk>
They're our <unk> of natural <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill all bacteria. They help to absorb anthrax than not being because they would cause large loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> people take three to four times longer in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of diseases.
<unk> also have enormous importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of control and maternity and, along with <unk> <unk> the unit between the Alto, and under Egypt.
In the <unk> <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In <unk> culture, they're very important <unk> to open sky in places like Tibet, there's nowhere to bury the dead -- or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are extremely <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> American communities, use this poison against predators, and as a result, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of endangered <unk> which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey to livestock consumption of livestock that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned by use in India and have taken a posture.
Since there's no <unk> there has been a <unk> in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge bomb bomb to <unk> The number of cases has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to the birds. The cut in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the market of <unk>
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so to focus on a sector problem. It's not going to be at all.
We have to work with governments at the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need of appreciating these wonderful creatures and the services that we get.
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise, you can write a letter to your government and tell you, we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures. They would take their time to spread the word.
When you go out of this room, you would tell them about <unk> but talk to their families, with their kids, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw them fly without effort, no energy spending on the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia. Kenya, Cote <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We went to the 21, that we Italians know, we were good people, and we were doing good work in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that we <unk> is going to do it.
Our first project that inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where we would just want to teach people from country to grow food.
So we got <unk> seeds to the south of Zambia into this absolutely magnificent valley to descends into the <unk> River, and we teach the local locals to grow tomatoes Italians and <unk> and ...
Of course, people weren't at all interested in doing that, so what they were passionate about to come to work, and sometimes they weren't quite amazed --  We were amazed that the local in this fertile fertile valley, they had no agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible that I didn't get to <unk> we just said, "Thank God that we are here."
And of course, everything in Africa is grown <unk>
We got these <unk> <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato in Zambia, to this size.
And we can't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy it is.
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red and the night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you get it, "You're never <unk>
I thought we only would love them to make mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans were doing -- what they did was they were doing the French, and they were doing what they were doing, and then I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
We will see the <unk> --  -- <unk> to see the waste that I gave you to <unk> people from Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> economist who are <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, countries, Western countries, we've delivered to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I won't tell you about the damage that the money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I'm dealing with any of a different culture as if they were my kids, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I'm dealing with all of a different culture as if you were my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- the little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said because of the economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> their own.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference up, put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to do 27 years just respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start with anything, you never get anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the local <unk> who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you? Do you <unk>
It will never be a community with an idea, and it sits on the people of the <unk>
We don't work from office offices.
We met in a cafe. We met a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what are you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important.
And then we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for a time, they gave them <unk> but not in the community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never had, and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have been <unk>
So, planning has this point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know about it, because they don't take their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You have to create a new career.
The profession is a family doctor from the company, the family doctor in the business -- that sets up with you at her house at the table on her kitchen, and that helps him find the resources to transform his passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia City.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to move away from this pedestrian <unk> where we came to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to see me to ask, "How can you do that?
How can I do that, and I said, "I did something really, really hard.
I love you --   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it for 300 communities in the world.
We have helped 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy professor before they get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of company <unk>
Planning is the kiss of the death of the spirit of business.
So now we are <unk> rebuilding <unk> not knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people and intelligence and passion?
What do you talk about is this tomorrow?
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil revolution -- not renewable <unk> and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> it's not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who will invent technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
<unk> government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a beautiful story that I read in a investment magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year of the year we got together this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wasn't within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population remains growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were being used in dung.  And so, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that we will build in New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States -- <unk> generic generic companies, <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories -- <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
But there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they will not come to talk with you.
Then you have to offer yourself a very dedicated <unk>
And then later you have to tell the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the larger company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic <unk> and you have to have a great financial management of it.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 world's icons of the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new new companies, <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one was started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
No one starts a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of a small business in <unk> in bars along with their dedicated examinations who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman is talking about this <unk> somebody who's asked to you, what should we need?
What can you? Do you?
Well, you can find the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, which is why we don't have a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects come from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay for more things without calling the door to a <unk> moment?
How do you share more memories from our abandoned buildings and understanding our <unk>
How do you share more our hopes for cows for cows so that our communities can reflect our own needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the wild birds that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
There's always supporting the music.  There's a parade in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures of the world, but also one with the most <unk> population of the U.S.
I live near this house, and I thought how I could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was suddenly sudden and unexpected was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this led to me a profound gratitude for the lived time.
It gave the clarity of the significant things in my current life.
But let's try to keep this look in my daily life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and painted about her sentences to <unk> "Before they died <unk>
So, <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died I want to be judged by <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on the line of <unk> change.
Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die I want to give you more time again.
Before I die I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and dreams and hopes of people would laugh at me laughing at me, and they gave me comfort at hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about to accommodate the reflection and <unk> and remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and started to receive hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center we did a kit, and now they've made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Australia, and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, it is more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
death is something that we often avoid talking, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that makes us more power.
Think of the death of the death of our life.
Our shared spaces can be better at what we care about individuals and as community and more media to share hope, the fears and the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my kids.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's high and very hot.
And not speech, but it gives joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> <unk> pass what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences and note -- it's never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to <unk> the words I didn't even know -- I remember one thing: how soon we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's high. It's very hot.
It was the more <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year where every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I would pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into a <unk> concept of society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though it was not consider it, it could only mean one thing: They were <unk> <unk>
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication and learning and sometimes physical skills.
In every single individual, it becomes different in a different way, where <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster increases in the world, no cause no cure.
I don't agree with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
It takes a lot.
I didn't want to play like other babies and actually didn't seem very much interested in me at all.
<unk> living and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and he was pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars around the room, looking at the washing machines, and eat anything that was between <unk>
As I grew up, it would come back more different, and the differences became more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> -- there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature, a kid who sees the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have been taught about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change by normal.
<unk> passes the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that anybody is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could get a single thing to <unk> and Sam and Sam and you would have to have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that we <unk> are a <unk> Each one of us has a gift inside and frankly, the pursuit of <unk> is the last sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the middle of the <unk>
Penn State asked me a teacher of communications, giving a computer of communications to students from engineering.
I was scared.  I was really afraid.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
And so I felt when I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a huge communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges -- from energy to environment and health care -- and if we don't know how to understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that this science is sexy and that its engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that you study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as they do dumb things.
Instead, as Einstein, said Einstein, is everything as simple as possible, but it's not simple.
You can communicate clearly their science without engaging ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, and stories and analogies -- it's ways to hook up with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
They have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do they do the <unk> and the bullets are killed and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's supporting too much in the area of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective. It shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then we will provide graphics that we would bring into our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what it is about.
I think these are just some key ones that can help others open the door and see the country of the wonders that's science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the entire Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor of the 19th century that he defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that he seeks to take a public charge no matter where he does, and when he won, it gets the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means to <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> camera.
And all this was thanks to the courage of a guy with the very unusual name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
He had thrown in the London Tower and he was beaten by him, but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end had such a popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of them think it's true.
It's not. It's for an advocate of the freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics are doing, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were presented to all kinds of suggestions you might have <unk>
Some people wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about tested quality.
And not even with that, they were <unk> they had the idea that you could actually be chosen King for a given deadline to it.
And there might be <unk>
The whole world got tired and <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the Pac-Man and <unk> was that the House of Representatives were against <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to become <unk>
They didn't want to call it King of him or his successor to ideas.
So they wanted to give the most <unk> more <unk> more <unk> and the most unfortunate thing came to them.
And that title was <unk>
President. It didn't invent the title. There was no longer before, but it only meant <unk> who was <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were presidents <unk> of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a trivial title.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take you seriously.
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate is not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite thing to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been a year -- the title of President.
President Barack Obama has kind of going on there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to stop waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and with this -- I want to tell you, is that the title of the President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to disposal, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of aerial air vehicles and so on.
Reality and history have been endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, kind of <unk> -- well, it was a <unk> then.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the kind of 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the House of <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that now you're the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to do is to <unk>
The politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and use the reality, but really, actually changes much more the words much more than the words that they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet below land in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak about but, above all, that cacophony of male <unk> and stones and <unk> with primitive.
As other people, I carry a cheap firefly <unk> it holds the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the branches that are holding the walls of that hole in a meter that drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
He <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a mining that I met days before, who lost control and dropped <unk> meters in that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep part of that hole to risk their lives without a reward and often dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they will never do it, because they're prey with slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the G8 Peace Summit in the <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there was <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO that is involved in eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and actually, I began to learn about slavery because I knew that there was a world in the world, but not as a degree.
When we ended up talking to me -- I was very proud to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how much people don't know?
It made me <unk> the stomach and weeks later, I flew in Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people <unk> in the world.
It's twice as much as the number of African Africans all tries to <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of an American worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars of the <unk>
But today you can sell entire families to entire families for <unk> debt <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates over <unk> billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled by false promise promises of good education promises and better work in order to find out that they are forced to work without K under violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery is operating on <unk> goods produced by slaves have value, but those who are produced are disposable people.
<unk> slavery exists around the world, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the furnaces of bricks.
This strange show and ideal show was like entering ancient Egypt or <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 C, men, women, children, in fact, entire families -- <unk> -- in a heavy trophy range of <unk> mechanically ventilated bricks in their heads, to 18 to the time, and they take them from the <unk> <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of meters.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> they work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 hours a day.
There was no <unk> to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> made it just just like <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot and he stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was very quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> Don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly that demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
You couldn't offer any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not citizen of that country.
He could put them in a worse situation than they were already gone.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his release and he trusted me to <unk>
As far as me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found kids carrying rocks for miles on the <unk> to the trucks that were waiting at the bottom.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who had <unk> and children would take them on their heads with <unk> and strings made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves and work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
You have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, they had had entirely completely <unk> home.
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness was told that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was inspired by women who had been previously previously <unk>
I took a little bit of a stairs <unk> who would give this <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more like a restaurant.
<unk> as you know the craft, they are local for prostitution, <unk>
They have small rooms -- small, private rooms where they <unk> them with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- are forced to <unk> the customers, and they dare buy more food and alcohol.
Each put on is dark and <unk> identified by a number that's painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
From foot in <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> and in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that hell.
He just had a <unk> the stairs where he <unk>
There were no doors.
There were no window enough to make it <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because you touch a difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, is going on all around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sexual <unk>
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families that had entire families put together on the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait of family.
<unk> black hands are the father, the blue blue and red, of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these large barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
We're still still able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where you really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children in the lake -- the biggest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I was going to take a look quickly.
I saw what it seemed to be a fishermen family on a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids, makes sense, right?
<unk> were all slaves.
Children are separated from their families and <unk> and forced to work large <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up there was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
The branches of the <unk> trees in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear, is thrown into the water to unleash the branches.
A lot of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
As a fear of his boss is not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> treated the youngest slaves under his seat.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they took the last networks, but they had been working from one another.
<unk> and <unk>
And it would be to point out that these networks weigh more than 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met it in a refuge in which the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi <unk>
Who will come to be because someone decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> <unk> the <unk> a partner <unk> with his bike.
It asked us to do it for a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were going to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then you signal this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started to go down, we removed the <unk> that we would walk down the path and after I walked about an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put my pictures on my photographs on my head as I put in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a soccer field, and they were all full of migrant workers.
Many women had children tied to their back and as they were looking for gold, <unk> in icy waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember he looked at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have to be 90 yards away, and these people carry heavy stone bag stone bag and then they will be shipped to another area where the stone would be able to extract the gold.
At the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer, you see the margin of the way we see the other less lucky and as well.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> is going to end up like this victim of T.B. and <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
By dying their uncle, <unk> inherit the debt of the uncle who will be a slave in the mines.
When I met him, I had worked on mines 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet that, he's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being released and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility -- which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to have testimony to them and we're going to do everything in order to help change their lives.
I really think that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very hard to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazine -- these are real people, like you and I, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I think I don't think about these beautiful people that I think I had the great honor to know.
I hope these images wake up a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that force turns a fire into a fire and that fire will make light light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do some particular math and there's a peculiar problem for whom <unk> are like management systems.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We are <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers of <unk> -- that we'll see later on.
But <unk> is a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill, and probably some early demonstrated <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's disease, destroy gradually this extraordinary ability to do with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time was a virtuous dancer ballet ballet ballet artist.
In the last few years, it's been a lot of progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> weakness <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately, the only way we will know if there is really a cure when we have an objective and objective metric of them.
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement are not <unk> and so they don't serve blood analysis and the best thing we have is a neurological exam of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside the clinical trials, they're never done. It's never done.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could do this once <unk>
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
And so what I want to do is that you know, as not a conventional way, you can see, in some sense at least -- we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of <unk> ropes.
It shows someone who is a healthy sounds when we talk about it, we can imagine as dancers of a vocal dancer because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sounds and all of the genes that we needed the genes for it, for example.
And, as the Holocaust requires a really extraordinary training.
Let's think about time that takes a child to learn how to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of the vocal cords as they <unk> and as Parkinson's is affecting the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom line you can see an example of the irregular shake of vibrating strings.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
<unk> IQ is not <unk> Both of the existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They're both <unk> OK, but they are also <unk> tests that are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
Very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're minimal cost, and we all know what happens to happen.
When something else takes a cost so far, it comes at the massive scale.
These are some incredible goals to address.
We can reduce the patient <unk>
I wouldn't do to go to the Harvard <unk>
We could often monitor <unk> we could get goals.
We could make a massive <unk> <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Women's <unk> Initiative,
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these goals.
We have accessible lines for about 750 million accessible people in the world.
<unk> with or without Parkinson's, you can call at the low price and put recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.  Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, say 10,000 people, they'll be able to say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call -- you have to indicate whether you're not the disease or not the disease. Sure.
<unk> You can see, some people may not get it; you may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the metal factors in pursuit of real markers of disease.
TR: You have a precision of accuracy at this time?
<unk> A lot more than that.
In fact, my graduate student, I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job, and now he's shown that it works on the mobile phone networks, which <unk> the project. Now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max public <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of March 2011, I made <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> creatures.
We sit in the dark, in the dark, no windows and, usually we avoid sunlight.
We make the thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin still more perfect -- we make the impossible, and we were going to get away in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of experience of experience and a real taste for the images and the photograph.
On March 11 of March 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly later, an organization where I was <unk> there was a place where I was <unk> there was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't sit sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13 of May traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishermen village located in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first towns affected by the wave.
The water level reached over 24 feet high, and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> rubble of the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools, broke the mud and leave the houses in order to be <unk> and <unk>
We took out tons and tons of dead fish, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We love us and loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> of photos and cameras and punch cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places of the villages around them to <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the toilets and the enormous, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor of that day to put the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard of the expression that I think beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I was going beyond my horizons.
By looking at the photos, I found some of them who had more than a hundred years ago, and I couldn't help to think of how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we needed to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to get it very accurately and <unk>
On the other way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her itself, and that would be as tragic as you had this picture of it.
Over the time step of the time, they became kind of more photos, and it got more <unk> so it went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people in 12 countries was offered to help.
In two weeks I had 150 people <unk> of <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a village to the north of <unk>
Once I had a week we use our scanner in the middle <unk> libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could take an hour. It could be a few weeks.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand, using a guide to the areas whose color and detail was not destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures big <unk> in saltwater, covered in bacteria, with seaweed, even oil, all of it with the step of the time I continue <unk> so it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean -- dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> we have a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more <unk>
As once once once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought up these pictures was kind of kind of like the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her same but stopped to realize that it was even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not have been able to <unk> we were able to put the pictures in a single picture and actually <unk> the whole picture.
When we collected their photos shared some of their history with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the pictures in a fire station, between the rubble pretty far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would cut it.
The day of the tsunami, their husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
His little child, not so small now, but their two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them was stuck in the water.
It took a week to find all his family and know that everyone was surviving.
The day I gave him his pictures his youngest son was 14.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could look at -- something that he could remember from the past that would not have been marked by that day in March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, and there were hundreds of them -- hundreds of them helped us clean up to more than <unk> photographs, and the great <unk> -- the vast majority of them came back to their own <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us back to 90 families and hundreds of photos totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we actually don't spend over 1,000 dollars of <unk> and materials, most of them in ink for <unk>
We take pictures constantly.
One picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, someone wanted.
They're <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would take us, but the first thing that we would look for.
So what the project was trying to restore small pieces of mankind, to bring someone back to someone with the past.
When a picture like this, you get back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that you get in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected to something larger -- will bring something larger -- using your talents to something that won't be thin skin models.
And so I would like to read this electronic email -- I sent it to Cindy the day I went from Japan after six months.
While I was <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular one, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> because a little bit of my family my grandmother, my grandmother, my mother, I and my <unk> daughter hangs away from our wall.
In the entire world, in every single few of our basic needs, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet walking through an apple in an exhibition of just one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion or a billion frames a second.
So I present to you a new kind of <unk> this is a new technical technique that can create videos of the light of light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can see behind the <unk> beyond the vision line, or see the inside of the body without the X-ray and the really challenging the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and you switch it into a <unk> <unk> it is, in various <unk> to create a <unk> package of just a millimeter wide.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, one million times faster than a common bullet in a half.
If we take that bullet and this <unk> package and <unk> in this bottle, how do you spread those photons into this <unk>
What is the light aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all this --  -- remember, all this happens in less than a <unk> is what takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light moving.
Coca-Cola is not going to do this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what is going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a photons package that starts to <unk> and inside, starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that bounce off inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel down the table and because of the insights at the top of the bottle, which is in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, which <unk> <unk>
Now, if you take a common and regular bullet and we make it run the same distance and we see it a slow camera at about 10 billion times, how much you think they would take you to see that film?
A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie --  from a slow slow motion.
And how about testing <unk>
You can see the waves coming out of the table, the tomato table and the bottom wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at once more and more of this <unk> you'll notice that, as the light gets rid of the tomato keeps <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and light bounce inside its inside and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at adulthood at once."
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture of the <unk> it goes into a very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition, so I barely get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons and millions of times, and we recorded one and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and <unk> in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow you to see it after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You get into the room, a part of it is going to reflect on the door, and that's from there to the camera.
Where we could get those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We have built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a dummy and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique abilities.
It has very good time resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point that is a distance.
So by projecting a laser you can record a raw, you can actually see on the screen, really doesn't make any sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like that, tens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction one.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are going to deliver collisions with what is around the curve.
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected through the open windows.
Or could we build <unk> capable of seeing the inside of the body through <unk> and the same thing for the <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood is quite difficult, so this is really hard, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new mode of visualization to solving the problems of mammography in health of the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he himself a scientist, I became science in art, an art of photographs of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the data <unk> we collected is not just for scientific visualizations but we can see it.
It will create a new form of computer photography with slow motion and colored codes.
And look at those ripples -- remember, the time between each of those waves of those waves is just a few <unk> a second.
But here it also happens something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> you go out of us.
<unk> should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects to see this image.
The order in which events happen in the world sometimes comes through the camera.
We will take the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> your life, and gives you free freedom.
With a mobile phone, you can get a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a smartphone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, you can get it back and get famous.
All of this is possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathering that they were looking for a change, had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who here are a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everyone today has a mobile phone.
But today I'm going to talk about me, my mobile phone, and how life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
Scientific data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the <unk> Commission presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European telephone company every single Internet provider has to store a wide range of information from the users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to who.
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, on their phone company or their Internet provider on the Internet.
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone and the Internet providers <unk> all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> don't <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret Germany of Germany China.
And I also asked myself if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> who then was the largest telephone company in Germany, and please give me all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I came back to them and I didn't get a particular answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to make a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, he was looking at an agreement.
And they would send the demand and they send me the information that I would <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing on brown with a CD inside.
And on the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand people would have 30 pieces of information.
I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this file.
I was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what data retention means.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open Street City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and worse, go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> to <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me talking a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call them between them.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we ended up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other and what time they call each other, which time you sleep.
You can see this all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the way of your society, because you know who speaks to who, send an email to who, if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, you had a cell phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, maybe never happened.
And as a result, neither is the fall of the <unk>
Because today the state agencies and business agencies want to store as much information from us as possible within and outside the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to go on forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When I get home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not just a fashionable story.
When they go home, they go back to their representative that only because business agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your company company what information they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that I think you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hi wow, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi wow, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, so I have cerebral palsy, and that's why we would spend all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus, of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, even though they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of you in this room.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you've wanted to be a disabled.
Let's go for a ride.
Christmas Christmas -- they're at the mall, drive in circles and parking lot and what do you see?
16 of 16 empty places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit of <unk>
In addition, I mean, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. just one of them.
If there was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you might have to.
I am in Yellowstone <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my illness had the same initial <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk out of my home to New York, it might.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you help them do <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters, sisters went to public school, my parents gave up to the school system, and they were <unk> that I was also out of it, and if we didn't take all the <unk> I all had the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of putting my breath in his feet and just walking.
The other tactic I used to be a dollar a dollar in front of me so that you did it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten kindergarten was walking as a <unk> champion who has received a lot of taps.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there's 20 and they continue to be all of the family.  I think no one realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as opposed to campaign.
The people I grew up with didn't have trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed like a lot to be made out of hunger during the <unk>
I would tell you that I had enough fat to live three months -- not eat, so <unk> the dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they were sent to school dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I am too.
And when my friends were going to go through New summer vacation at the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I was going through my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were going to become <unk>
On summer holidays often my father tried to <unk> so I was drinking <unk> and so I was drinking cups on the back, I was stuck in the Red Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before we do yoga was a <unk> comedian who couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant for the <unk> University of Arizona, because I went into all the <unk>
It was like <unk> pet <unk>
I all love me.
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene of the glass length of my professors <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a piece called <unk> <unk> in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> I finally have a <unk>
I have <unk>
<unk> <unk> At the end of it.
Thank God <unk> at the end of this I'm <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running at the director of the theater, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to ask him why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't do the risk scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a role for the one that I had literally been born and gave it to an actor without a cerebral <unk>
College was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disabled papers.
As I graduated home, I went home, and my first tour <unk> was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be a <unk> of <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, it stayed there as a <unk> it doesn't look more than the <unk> and it was evident to me that the directors of <unk> actors, not white, not white, <unk>
Only let's get perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
That's why I became <unk>
On my first tour, I took a famous comic in New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that took when he fell into the realization that he was at high speed by the New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic, and also <unk> and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little unpleasant rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find ourselves very fun.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the Festival of the <unk> <unk> of New York, now in her 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and then reminding you to remind the directors, directors, that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the stigma of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited to the news program <unk> it has Keith <unk>
I walked in as if I went to a graduate dance, I was signing up to a study and sat down in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clung to the news desk to not get out of the screen during the <unk> and when the interview, ended up <unk>
I had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was kind of like the <unk> and I pasted my chair.
Something that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
And the kids are said to be <unk> but they never get away from me or a little girl and no older <unk>
Suddenly my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite wife, <unk> terrorist <unk>
What disease is that?
We should really be praying for it.
A <unk> suggested even to add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> as visual as the race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't do somebody in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yeah, man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said not to be <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with the media, and I don't think they <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that makes you less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I came to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world -- "The Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in depiction of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity organization to give children Syrian refugee kids, a tiny bit of what my parents would give me.
It was the only time my father saw me in live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I would like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives small people to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without all, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, no job, no other future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he gets about a gentleman who offers him to take him to <unk> after dinner, <unk>
He knows a dynamic group of people, which gives a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to her family.
He presented to a young man.
I finally got home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
One beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb car.
That little boy in that little town with the <unk> of the great city, was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were a terrorist organization with the Qaeda.
So, how do the story of a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for it.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that got him out of what we call "the <unk> period.
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young unemployed young people who have <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond <unk> <unk>
For the young people, the great dream of the city, the great dream of city is the opportunity, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't give them opportunities -- the history of <unk> the door of <unk> the door to terrorism, the violence -- will be the history of cities rate.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 doesn't work, it's not going to school.
They do virtually nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital in the hospital where I was born.
I remember standing in front of that hospital to <unk> thinking, and if I never had he gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support some youth leaders at a business rate.
It was about 90 juvenile leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had a ideas of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, that because he was a graduate college student, it was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other African-American organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war, have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It began a company of <unk>
It began <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand to hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this different story do?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I believe that the corporate spirit may be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
They encourage young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking so hard.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was forced to train some of the young people at the summit of corporate initiative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from the abroad.
If you give it to somebody, "When was the last time you saw <unk> flowers.
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is, <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company for <unk> and design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow the <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive hard climate <unk>
And it began the delivery of flowers for wedding -- creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies, and now he's working in the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
She wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and like he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not growing pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for a NGOs, working for the government, but their story, their innovation actually had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
encouraged to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that might be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So we inspire young people and creating a culture of business spirit -- really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to be able to put them into development and put it out of their businesses.
They encourage young people with the resources that they need, and they need the support that they need to move from understanding to the creation, and will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Its <unk> that's what it calls when it's created, when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired children from the street to help rent and keep the bike for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn young people in the entrepreneurs, <unk> and feeding their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk> that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> mountains, a <unk> area in New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun made it that the leaves made up like a <unk> and not to be on the path that we were going to <unk> we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings on Walk that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> shed on a beautiful lake with a beautiful lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to be able to pull out what they thought was going to clean his <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how it <unk> or where you do -- the <unk> who cleans our trash in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> cleans our trash, and the reason for 11 tons of waste and two thousand tons of <unk> product every day.
I wanted to know to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who I did that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and get that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and walked through their pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and facilities in every city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go further into more.
So I began to work like <unk> <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in trucks. I have them.
And they operated <unk> mechanical and bar <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
You all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think, and in the days that it's very strong -- you get rapidly <unk>
It costs a lot of used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the 10 most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and entering traffic all day and pass around around you.
They just want to do that, so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that they often fall in the truck, and cause terrible matter.
I also learned about how relentless of garbage.
When you leave the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is like a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or your circulation.
It must always be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that the stigma is especially ironic because I think the <unk> of waste are the most important workforce on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficient and effective way every day, this starts to get rid of their containers and their dangers inherent we are also threatened in very real ways.
For decades, for decades, and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we don't have space for what the motors of the economy started to fail when it's endangered at the consumption of consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just pointed out its relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed necessary.
So I mean just at the speed to which we used to move to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't get stuck. We have cleaned up or cleaned up with our coffee cup -- our bag of coffee <unk> our water bottle.
We use it, the <unk> forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that is taken to it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste data that might help reduce the stigma and adapt it into that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day <unk>
They use a uniform in a lot of cities.
Do you know when they were <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keep us apart from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a food collection truck on the street, I grabbed my little son and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of <unk> as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank her for doing his work that day, but I started to cry.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be OK."
Shortly after that, I began to investigate waste and I went back to this man.
It's called <unk> we work together and we did good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we have to include and to account for all the costs, even the cost of very real human labor.
The municipal waste that we think when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the amount of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and in their lives, the next thing that you see somebody whose work is to clean up the garbage of you, let me give you a moment for <unk>
Let me take a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection to thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example began with an invitation to design a shopping center of several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Challenge.
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, to my team and me about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go <unk>
So after seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to use a lot of energy because the lining of <unk> generates heat into the interior, so it takes a lot of <unk>
In a city where this isn't going to happen because it comes to a temperate range that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And third, his aspect has nothing to do with Africa and in Ethiopia.
It's a worth for a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted by the old market that is this structure to open air where thousands of people, they go and buy things every day small <unk>
That's also that idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought that was what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to <unk> the site, which is located in a very much growth area of the city, where much of the buildings we now see in the image, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets between these two streets <unk>
And this is happening with a <unk> <unk> that creates a space to open air into the building that was shaped by its own shape, in the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we're going to adapt to the local weather conditions.
And I started thinking about a fabric like a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air input and also of the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on the dresses of <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and it helped me model <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it didn't be easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center, it was not what we <unk>
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market would be much more profitable than the mall because in order to account for the accounts there was more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings for the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is short almost every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting it on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this desert website.
And these <unk> on the roof, which are collect water for <unk>
It is expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the biggest I ever had, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a dozen years of access that were connected by the lines of nearly straight.
When I went to the place, the first operating operation that we did was extend the streets that we did that we were to expand the streets that were initial blocks of the size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some particular dots in relation to the idea of the doors with straight lines, and this changes the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So <unk> a scheme that ensures that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks of <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set up a higher density in higher levels and a lower density in the lower plant.
And it <unk> this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving out to the community -- the joint space of construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and get them up, and do such a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people change communities and local economies at the same rate that buildings grow in.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and that they have as objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had big hair with very bright hair, and a little <unk> <unk> it was super hard for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was filled with jealousy, until I had my sinister plan.
One day I was left time after the <unk> I was a little evening and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked in the classroom, I took from my school table from my master's book table.
And then I did.
I put up the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few of these.
So all of the Like <unk>  And I set back to the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other fellow colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them all rows from <unk> and myself in a row here, just because of being there, because we <unk>
I'm still amazed what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I would never get there.
It's that everything was <unk>
I will never tell me.
But above all, I'm going to tell you the reason why I was bothered by that this little girl who was so small, was so good to <unk>
I get rid of jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. People tiles are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet I have never seen a study that will be used or the long duration or the sadness.
So I have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the laboratory in which the <unk> are looking at them in all possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know whether it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> I wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> no <unk> and a <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
I took the <unk> lists from high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of jealousy, most of them.
This year they meet 100 years of his masterpiece, "In search of <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of mine, all we might have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forget how hard that image is.
We forget how relentless it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk>
I don't know how the cat, <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy, that are reduced to person, their wish, their <unk> are a good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being to the <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details would be like to nail the <unk> right?
<unk> are making us every amateur <unk> and that's something they <unk> understand.
All that she does to give me pleasure could be pleasure right now, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every genuine fresh that <unk> detects it in his lover, adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break out of it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are we <unk>
The <unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the big amounts of hair, bright hair, and the cute little hair <unk>
The <unk> were <unk> of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful -- <unk> links well the language <unk> with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in their <unk> pain, listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know that this is <unk> but it's not different than the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's all scientific research with real value <unk>
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in your <unk> they're finding knowledge, search for the truth, a really painful truth, in fact, to <unk> <unk> the more agonizing the truth, better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs to, which makes us suffer, it causes us to be a range of the much deeper feelings and vital that a wise man who can <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
Is there any other emotion of us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at such a <unk> basically.
Freud would write about this later on.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife would <unk>
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, which is not <unk> in what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife, and he doesn't know <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or is it accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
novels are very good at this.
All novels described very well how the <unk> make us look at intensity but not accurately.
In fact, the more intensely we are, we are, more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent and illegal acts for it.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking of myself about eight years old, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard of the news.
A woman of Michigan of 52 years old, was just captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since he was sent horror messages to himself, for a year.
A year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of his former <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How big though is it?
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> books try to measure how the jealousy, <unk> our minds and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes out of <unk> or wanting what you have to reach out of your being and <unk> from what you've ever seen, and it's under the floor -- you get to your name, takes your rings, carrying your <unk> your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, as well as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where is the currency <unk> right?
Now novels show you the <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they are not secure, when they're at a mystery.
Let's go to the Baker <unk> Street and ask, by <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the curse curse in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been willing to say, <unk> <unk> the head of rat <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but it would do it and do it with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you walk in, <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> back to <unk> and he says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't like to leave her hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> came in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, not emotion.
You know, in a minute that's the opposite side of <unk>
And the next minute they're on the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> it allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
Could it be so simple?
What if <unk> actually are a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like the plans of <unk>
So as we expect that to happen, we remember that we have fiction for <unk>
Just the fictional fiction jealousy.
<unk> alone invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> the scary thing to do, Tom <unk> the mad time."
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the pages of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and queens were alone, but his presence in the gray floor was the culmination of a collective process of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the biggest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of day day, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 companies, universities and universities and government agencies.
They died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, which comes back after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that the president Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F.
Why make it turn into our goal?
And you might ask, why scale the most <unk>
35 years ago, why is it flying over the <unk>
Why play Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> for the <unk> the Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West over the east in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> before the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the Moon happened in a context of a long list.
The first half of the 20th century, produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they were <unk> the <unk> and the smallpox <unk>
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a <unk> ship, but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles / hour.
Since 1970s, no human being has gone back to the moon.
Nobody has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful <unk> about the power of technology has been <unk> by seeing that the problems that we imagined that technology would solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seem to have a result.
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
He was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't go to the <unk> tube <unk> the <unk> Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would get to see colonies on Mars.
So that from "Something's happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here at TED.
It looks like if the technologists had found us, and they've enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't understand the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an ongoing explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have created less ambitious companies that were <unk> from the years that we were at Intel Microsoft, Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> specifically the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused the creation of <unk> ideas for funding and even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It was mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high peak without worrying about the risk, they would be small investment investment than they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always been problems to invest in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and the development of the long-term capital -- they have never invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose to do not solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason it's completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want to have alternative energy sources that can compete at price -- don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are agree about what policies and international treaties -- a significant increase in the research and development of energy development, and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in today's political climate that we will see an American policy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seemed technological, it turns out not to be.
We know from time that famines are a result of failure in the delivery of food.
But 30 years of research have been taught that famines are political crisis that affects the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like the harvest or systems for the storage and food storage and <unk> but there will be famines as bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The Nixon president declared the war on cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and should, but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to want to solve the problem: the institutions must support the <unk> it should actually be a <unk> problem and we need to understand it.
<unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it has to be <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there's no popular science of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have been about trust.
They're so common that they have become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a great decline of trust, is a very general wisdom.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should reclaim trust.
I think the <unk> and the task has been wrong.
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about it.
First, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It turns out to think that there may be a few and a few activities or institutions and that could have risen on others.
I don't have it.
But I can look at polls and opinion polls are supposedly the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at these surveys over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, follow the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still quite <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen citizen is almost exactly halfway through.
But is this evidence enough?
What the opinion polls records are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you see are <unk> attitudes that people are when they ask certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
I probably will say, by asking, "What for?"
And that would be a very scary response.
And you could say, when you answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other not."
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to secure trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel like a certain kind of official <unk> or type of person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain teacher that I know to give you the reading, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools, to measure the real level of real trust, because they're trying to deal with the good judgment an inherent trial in fact to trust something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's an objective target.
This is not the goal that I would have.
I encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I am <unk> not to trust what's not reliable.
And I think that those people who make their savings with very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think, in them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, yes, it says, yes, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do is do a judgment on how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in raw materials, and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible we can't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but they don't have to take a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that I think it will be <unk>
And I'm so happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're looking at to look at before we trust.
Trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be.
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last decades, we've tried to build accountability systems for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, who made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember, I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is it takes more time to make the administrative <unk> that I attend to be in <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public lives, and we would argue that the accountability system that is destined to guarantee the <unk> and the <unk> evidence is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they do the work of the work of people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that we are <unk> as we say.
You've got all of you all know similar examples.
We put all that, through the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were going to make it worthy of trust and encourage people that we are reliable and if we try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple action, the <unk> which doesn't do it properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to reconstruct the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit the trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, in short, it's <unk> because they give them <unk> other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations of enough to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford it for the general world, all the time.
But you also have to bring <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That goes on every day, everywhere, it does the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The shop where I buy my socks on it says I can <unk> without giving us better.
I take them back and get me back money, or you change them by the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and trust in what you're saying.
So, at the end, I think what we're pointing at is not very hard to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the early computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly becoming more and more and more and more, to such a day that is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
I first created this tool that gets deeper into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the diverted screen is the physical body to the pixel at the West.
Designers can take their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool <unk> the barriers.
But the two hands still stay out of the screen.
How do you get to the inside and interact with digital information using your entire hands?
In the division of Science <unk> I went from Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
It would take a transparent bombsight with cameras that are deep to detecting their fingers and face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, reach inside of 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and files have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as taking a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and emphasize lines or words with the tactile tactile sensor that is down every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we are <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest papers and we make digital information come to us?
<unk> many of us would have bought and returned to things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this far further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physical and <unk> and <unk>
What would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator collaborator Post, we created this only physical <unk>
This neocortical magnet is behaving like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> the gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And in programming the object, we release it from the restrictions of time and space, which means that human movements can come back and go back to reproduce and they have forever in the physical world.
You can teach you physically and physically distance and famous <unk> by Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or the text, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday mental activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something but begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to <unk> our world.
We started the talk today of a barrier, but if you put that barrier, the only limit that is left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was stuck to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After we survive the Islamic Revolution, they create firmly that there was just a way down to the <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter what I would like or not.
But my dream was to be an African opera building.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer should start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the speaker of a radio show.
But no adult would get the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at age 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that for the rest of my life a second class was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
Nobody around me wanted to be <unk> OK.
Let's go back to the books.
<unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to America in 1995, and what was the first books that I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk>
And it's not a complete <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
I said, "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> guilt trap.
The encounter with a new culture also gave me place to my <unk> reading habit.
It makes a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me, because this is what students in China learn from.
I had never happened, China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not new.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There's to research fields like religion and comparative literature.
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if reading actually worked for research, why not do it in <unk> life.
So I started reading books at two.
They can be about <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
By <unk> the <unk> are economic and politics and <unk>
To the Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and duty to make it <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
["The <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> ["The <unk> Alan <unk> instead of being lost in the translation, I found that you can get a lot of it.
For example, it's through translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people in the past and of the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I used to.
Having a dream is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I have come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of sleep.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, of where the passion comes from, where happiness.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first client in <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in psychology clinic in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
And Alex came into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> dropped on the couch of my office pulled off the shoes and told me that he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a first client.
And I was a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex would bring to the <unk> it became easy for me to move the head up as the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and what I looked like, she was right.
You start to work later, I get home later, you have children later, to death later.
For the <unk> as Alex and I had plenty of <unk>
But shortly after, my <unk> <unk> pushed me to press that I talk about his life <unk>
I was hooked.
I said, "Yeah, it's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like being married with him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it <unk> on the next.
In addition, the best time to work on Alex marriage is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex being the perfect time, and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk>
There's 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
That means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one gets to age age without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yes. They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> they remove the dream of a <unk> I want to see. It's okay. It really matter.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be about 35 years old.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments and moments that give you a way to your life will have happened to be 30 and <unk>
People of the age of 40, they don't <unk>
This audience will be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we get.
We know that over half of Americans are married, they live or they are coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and final stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> to <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change from themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life, and we know that the female fertility comes to their top to the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time for <unk> over their body and their options.
When we think about the developing child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there is something called an adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
So newspapers talk about changes in the line of the time of <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
So journalists <unk> their names <unk> the <unk> as <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and you say, "You're 10 years old to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing happens.
And then every day, I'm really interesting like you or your children and your kids get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this is a <unk> I'm just killing time for the time.
Or they say, "All say as I start a race before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better reproduce the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running, but then at some point around the '30s, was turned out the music and they all started sitting.
I didn't want to be the only one who was going to stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the ones <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme -- but it doesn't get the stakes to be very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there is a huge amount of pressure on the 30 and so many of them starting a city, pick a mate, and have two or three children in a much longer period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there is some research that start to show that it's much more difficult and stressful doing everything from once to <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the race you want now.
Realizing you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> they look at themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was he doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the ones are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma got to my office because he was in his own words, having a identity crisis.
He said that he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but she could still not decide, decide, so spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, he lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living some very difficult, his previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then she gets up to the saying, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I'd spent the whole morning with his many <unk> but then you had a lot of the empty space that follows after the words in <unk> case, please call me <unk>
He was about the <unk> when he saw me and he said, "Who will be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me to take care of me.
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I wouldn't say, <unk>
The thing that Emma needed was not a <unk> which is actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as just sitting in the way I was trying to sit as I was <unk>
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all of the man or a woman, she deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who was moved from that crisis of identity, and the identity of identity.
For identity, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of the career of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: capital of identity creates capital of identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> exploration -- I'm <unk> exploration that shouldn't be to count, which, by the way, is not exploration there.
It's <unk>
I told Emma that would explore jobs and make them tell.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are so great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with our minds are limited in terms of who you know how to think about how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, this new person who was going to go out almost always comes from the outside of his nearest circle.
The new things come from what they're called weak ties of friends of friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or not work.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the shape of <unk> to this group.
Half of the jobs would never be <unk> then to know the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
By the last one, but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose his family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing, but like <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family, when he has a couple and form his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to lay my mind that 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live in now or you're going to tell you now when all of the Facebook they start to walk towards <unk> is not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have it, and that means to be so intentional in love as you are at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or killing time with whoever is that you can bring them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, I went through that <unk> and she found the roommate in a cousin who worked in a museum of art in another state.
This weak bond helped me get a job there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave boyfriend, who live on.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married man who chose consciously <unk>
I love her new career, he loves her new family, and he sent me a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not really good enough.
The story of Emma can sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like planes coming out of the London Airport coming out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight match in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at the same way for 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects on the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the way that you know.
It's as simple as I learned to tell <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of telling the <unk> like Emma every day -- <unk> are not the new <unk> and they get their <unk> get from identity, use their weak ties. Get your family.
Don't let them define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left very hard work in management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics at seventh of the public schools in New York City.
And as any teacher, I took tests and tests.
Let me give you tasks.
When I work back, I will encourage grades.
What I called my attention was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and the worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance, they didn't have credit I.Q.
Some of my smartest children were not doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these things are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
Is it the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and life in life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a rapid way and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of scenarios -- and in every study, my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what they were going to do, and they were in the military training and who they <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what kids would do as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> professors working in really hard neighborhoods -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the year of school and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the learning results of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, which of these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, arose a feature as a significant success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have resistance.
<unk> is clinging to his future, day after day, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students that did my <unk> of determination and then waited over a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly higher chance of <unk> even when they were <unk> in every single feature that I could measure, things like family income, scores of evidence -- even the safety that children felt when they were in school.
So it's not just in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also at school, especially for the children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little people know about their development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you development determination in kids?
What should I do to teach children a solid job ethic.
How do I keep them motivated by the long <unk>
The more honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't follow with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the <unk> is commonly related or it's even related to the Olympic measures.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, it can change with it.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when children read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to be <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have through the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to try and start to start all again with the lessons that are <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories -- is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was obsessed with this incredible language.
But for a abroad it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can bring down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learn Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I began to learn how to draw every one of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than doing it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy for basic literacy people.
The first 200 will allow them to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read signs of traffic traffic signals, to understand the basic idea of the pages or the newspapers.
Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it's <unk>
They get a mouth of mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a ride.
<unk>
If the way of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if they were shouting at the way, <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of the flame -- but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
<unk>
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors on a <unk> in the old West <unk>
I call a <unk> to these eight characters.
These are building blocks so that they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old man, two are a company, three are crowd.
If one person reaches your arms, this person is saying <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a grape such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a tree speaker, it's quite an idiot.
Do you remember that?
Two thousand together, it gets very hot.
Three step together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and night.
The sun goes on the horizon.
One door. Hold a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> a guy at home?
This person is coming out hidden from a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, keep care is <unk>
So we've been in almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical ones, will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with every small effort, you're going to be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same thing as you learn a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun.
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> who are <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become <unk>
A mouth that tells you where you go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician magician together.
The movie was <unk> for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave her a brilliant excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand
But when you see that film, so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raised our children in a kind of industrial complex an industrial <unk>
However, the <unk> of Oz was an event itself.
It doesn't start that trend.
The trend actually took 40 years later later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal boy and a guy who <unk> a girl wearing a girl in the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about? Yeah.
There's a great difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the <unk> of the Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence on the magician magician <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the business magician will do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz like prophecy.
I would make some magical shoes to defeat the armies made by the evil evil of the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the <unk> of the Oz is that the most <unk> wise characters are women.
I started to notice this when I did to see Star Wars a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
Only three years old.
I was not invited to projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the oxygen level there was <unk>  And so she slid in the room and he was amazed as a mom and she was left with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but I don't think he would have everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be issues of value, <unk> and <unk>
I wouldn't feel the feeling that Luke was one of the army to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the <unk> Oz
How do I win Dorothy your film?
We do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up, and not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why do you have so much new capital force in the movies for our kids, and so little of the <unk> <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence on the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how children react to this encouragement.
I know because of experience that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the moment of the first laugh, I really expected them to come out because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have a <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
<unk> are focused on <unk> the <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be an animal <unk> and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and I'm going to stand at the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they, kids, they're not really your target audience.
They do a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend girls versus <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, so lovely and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times continues on appearing in classic <unk> in classic one of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a girl.
As many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend it. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out there?
I can't believe that Pixar has done a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that get <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies is the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book guy, and in the <unk> recorded a conversation I'd had with a friend about the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the movie, more than a female character who has lines?
So the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else from the guy who is <unk>  Right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality movie, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success of <unk> a consensus idea of what a Hollywood movie is.
<unk> doesn't happen <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes from men who have deep deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors, to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at the numbers.
In 2011, from the most popular movies, how many of them think they have no shading that they are <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a number bigger than this one that is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, right?
One in the United States, one in five women says it has been sexually assaulted once in his life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I believe that music music or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is there is a huge amount of sex.
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence, and then taking the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to take it up.
We have tools like <unk> <unk> and we expect that to be <unk> but I have to ask, "Can you go to <unk> if at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is radically changing.
You've read about how new economy is changing the role of the <unk> and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite favorite character of "Star <unk> Do you know what they <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to try to reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I will tell my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where their job looked like to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician magician <unk>
Thank you.
I was living in Maine, I was living in Maine, and one of the things I liked was looking at sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
And yet, over time, I was forced to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and the archeology.
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine, I had grown up to one of almost 1,300 miles of length.
And the sea crackers had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern east of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in the naked eye, it seems to be brown, but when we use the infrared and we process it using some fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink pink space.
What you're seeing are the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by the manufacturing materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used the satellite data to find an old city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this enormous <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it measures roughly <unk> per miles.
Before, Nile Nile right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, they moved into this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape?
And I'll try and find that random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with <unk> eyes, and using baseball.
So we use NASA <unk> data to make a map of place with very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where we get the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly <unk> that you see inside the circle here, that we thought might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with scientists making <unk> <unk> you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the sample of sample in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look at layers of human occupation we look at ourselves.
Five meters down, underneath a thick thick layer of carbon, we find a dense layer of <unk> objects.
That means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a <unk> layer of several hundred years that date back from the Middle Empire -- exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry, they used these are the rocks that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a penguin jewelry shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we don't find a place in a future near <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire of the Middle Empire -- probably was written in <unk> 6,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on land.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas really started in 1984 B.C. C. In a lost city not for a long time and found from high time.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that he's made.
Now <unk> a group of obese people in bicycles.
They are competing in a career <unk> race and go in the direction to their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> they are <unk> they are <unk>
They collide in front of the door.
There are bicycles flying around, which goes on on the side of the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the gate, <unk>
So the lobby, the hall, or whatever is on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.

It's a horse that speech.
You can feel your blue <unk> doing tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you can pass it into your mouth.
They went on one side and enter their living room.
In the room, and making maximum use of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
There's little clothes, dancing on her home center, singing <unk> <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go back to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a path of yellow brick and from the oven coming to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping towards you.
Okay. You open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes place every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, I guess, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few dozen different ages and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers <unk> them just once.
We had the names of tens of strangers.
We took entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomena.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best memories <unk>
I asked her, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition say that they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous action acts of memory using some old techniques invented a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives and that medieval academics used to memorize books on it.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have heard this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English guy, but a little bit of <unk> he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how do you memorize the order on a deck of cards -- live on national TV.
That will prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me me.
I mean, you have to start by a <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very bizarre journey for me.
And I finished spending most of the year next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work, and what can be their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad I didn't even remember that I had a problem with <unk> is awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how far our memory does that we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent a afternoon in the public library in the Salt Lake City <unk> guides <unk> was <unk>
And in return, I read a lot of treaties on memory written over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> and disciplined memory and <unk> was not a thing as rare as it can be like today.
A long time, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they have changed.
They have changed the <unk> and I would say that they have changed also cognitive skills.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory and <unk> this particular competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College London invited a group of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know, will be that it has brains in some sense, structural or different <unk> of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than <unk>
They gave them a battery <unk> and the answer was actually not.
But there was a really interesting difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI machine, they would take your brains while <unk> numbers, faces and forms of snow <unk> they found that in the online champions they found out of the brain champions different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something that we can learn from this?
The tournament in <unk> competitive is driven as an armed race in where each year comes up with somebody with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors have to get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times of memory.
On his desk in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who is about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the order of <unk> digits -- <unk>
<unk> now. Yeah.
And as there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these competitions, absolutely all the techniques used in the end, is reduced to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates a elegant paradox known as the paradox of <unk> <unk> says this: I say to two people who remember the same word. I'm saying to you, <unk> -- there's a man named <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, "Do you say there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later on, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who was told that his name is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said his job is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> capacity.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything to you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all the other memories you dance for your head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk>
They are okay when they go home to work.
You probably would take some <unk>
And when you look at that word for the first time, we started to put <unk> <unk> for <unk> at some time later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is about 2,500 years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is like this: There was a poet called <unk> I attended a <unk>
I had hired him as a entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, they didn't get to a <unk> you would get to a <unk>
He stood up to me and put her poem from memory, and he was <unk> and he was, and he was, <unk> <unk>
They went to everybody.
But not only killed all of them but it shattered the bodies of <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting there.
So they could not be able to get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only <unk> in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I was sitting every single day.
I took the relatives of the hand <unk> where they were his loved ones between the rubble.
What we had to do is pick up the moment that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions by the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and exceptional spatial memory.
If I told you that I would tell you -- the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to find it very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you told you to tell you who I was sitting on the horse that the brown horse, you would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of the memory is to create this building with your mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember. The more crazy -- and the <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is the picture, more <unk> it will be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> of memory in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from memory, in the same way that I would have done it -- if they had been invited by <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that utterly <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on the <unk>
And that will recall that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then they fly in the kitchen, and the fourth theme that they talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year -- and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how <unk> speakers are <unk> not word by word, that are going to confuse them but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people were thinking about <unk> and rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in its palace of memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got into that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of <unk> competitive.
But there was a problem.
The problem was a memory competition is a <unk> event.
But really, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting on <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing happens is when someone gets <unk>
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in the place.
So I began to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school fund bought in a market of <unk>
And I discovered that this was entertaining.
I would never have expected you to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it's actually about doing is better and more and more of the ability to create and imagine these images, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of your mind.
I was really excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of safety covers covered with ribbon leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same competition that I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could put in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this might be good for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to memorize narratives and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just so much tricks.
Because they are based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to have it necessary to build the memory <unk> or memorize <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
Big memories <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
You are deeply focused when we focus on.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It will be a kind of deep processing kind of processing -- a kind of complete focus that most is not <unk>
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
This is how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I would do, the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walk our side to our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even bother processing <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you should be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex subject, so we would just take a place that would be <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> <unk> I was six years old, and I lived there at home from my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were everybody going on to see television and so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everyone was over, and every time I got married, and I would get wrapped up in a towel -- everybody was seen.
And I was like this.
I was <unk> and I hated it.
I hated that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
Right.
Those feelings, those emotions I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, no <unk> <unk> but of those connections that are emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we get.
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because the American <unk> Agency spend 90 percent of their time under <unk>
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
That means when I show you a building like this, I know what you're going to do, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that you think about that based on a building built a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and the governments, always have fear of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know that they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public <unk> Library of <unk> which ended in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> has this round thing, and Palestinian brick brick -- that they leave <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> children, the body values -- history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, the other library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new type of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> the architects that are constantly driving new technologies, new technologies, new solutions for today's lives.
We were going to let us all of us and let them get away from us so far away from the people.
And all of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel very good, but we're dead in because we don't have another option.
We have to go to the other side and go back to the other <unk> symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we start experimenting with <unk> we can swing the <unk> back to go ahead and over and over again. So we've done this in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, <unk> from the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small <unk>
Something really hard.
So we reach the 1980s, and we started bringing those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we add bake and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we made them in skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The shapes are <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
It's crazy.
But the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time at commercial centers, we move into the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be the <unk> or the French or the Italian person.
And perhaps with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and started to <unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
The <unk> symbols now have new design techniques now we have a computer design techniques and we found it with new kinds of shapes that would become against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You get totally <unk>
Normally, <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those <unk> when <unk> academics in general, they were completely according to a building.
The New York Times newspaper, this building <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao went up in a half and a half thousand percent when they ended the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, concentrating <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these sort of wild and <unk> and how it is possible to become ubiquitous across the world?
And it happened, because the media was <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
The same mayors were made of the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennials happened with other U.S. architects.
And I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, in fact, began to happen with all the architecture.
Think of it, for example, how do they consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> they can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building goes beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't really precise time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before I know that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we meet buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a <unk> movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we didn't have any idea how much they are.
That's never going to happen.
My theory is that when it applies to the media <unk> it starts to swing increasingly fast, until you get on both extremes of <unk> and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community -- and like drawings looked like the product done, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started getting and shared in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that you made from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory and to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building was built today, first <unk> the Internet in search for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> which can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell them that there's no unique answer to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experiment.
Everything is different now.
And architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complicated, and you are no longer a <unk> public who doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
architects can listen, and you don't let you listen to the architecture.
That means that the pendulum pendulum <unk> of one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find <unk> solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick based on ideas of what it should be a <unk>
This means that some robots can build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings would be <unk> the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage, in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to make sports or for <unk> or even one can marry there at night.
This means three architects can <unk> in the East Side of New York, and in New York City, and raising half a million dollars of the community attached around that cause, it's no longer a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals going to observe.
Because no longer matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
architects already know how to make more <unk> and more friendly buildings.
We've been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we're not on opposite places.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings are not just reflecting our society, but they give it way to the most <unk> spaces of local libraries -- the homes where we went to our children, and the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it does this very typical way of the children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things you like to do is look in the mirror.
She really loves her <unk>
<unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and it made me think.
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10 thousand people are looking at any of these, "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, it just wants to be loved and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because, even though his mom tells him the whole thing that's beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells him it's ugly.
Among what his mom tells him and what his friends, or fellow colleagues say, doesn't know who to believe.
So a video of her itself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others that please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has received more than 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think of them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenager who receives these answers into one of the most vulnerable lives of their more vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, in most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what are you carrying to do this?
Well, teenagers today are almost not alone.
They're under pressure from being online and available all the time, talking, to get <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in his room in his bedroom all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that are coming out of hand is <unk>
This environment, it's always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There is no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what correctly, digitally.
What is the greatest thing in somebody's life, which is normal in a daily context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> size continue to dominate our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those that <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what young people are at.
But the kids are not immune to this.
It's like the <unk> of sports stars and the folk singers.
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we probably want our children to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in an <unk> culture, we are teaching our children to spend more time and effort and mental effort to their look, the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other things start to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for growth as human beings and how to serve society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenage teenagers are not interested in the classroom. They are going to participate in the classroom because they don't want to call attention by their physical form.
One in five are not attending classes at all over the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the fishing season, if you don't think you're seeing it well, specifically if you don't think you're good enough -- you get a lower note to the average of your fellow who don't care about it as appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the U.S. and China.
And it starts regardless of what these young girls actually are.
So, to be right of course, we're talking about how you see it, not what you're like.
The low self-esteem on their body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem are less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they do not healthy that they can lead to a food disorder, they do.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> for the people around them and are at greater risk of depression.
And we thought it's all about this because of what they make more effective decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diet aesthetic surgery, aesthetic sexual ages and no protection and harm damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we are not <unk>
Women who believe they're overweight again, regardless of whether they have or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women are not presented to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way they see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that deal be?
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms -- the first one is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of good programs <unk> without realizing it would take the situation.
So we should make sure that the program that our children follow is not just a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six things are starting starting to make an education in your body self-esteem that will work.
One education is <unk> but dealing with this problem requires each one of us to take charge on the issue and be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
So challenging the status of the current women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you about the contribution of our politicians into <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the success of a Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people by what they are, not because they see.
We can all begin by taking responsibility by the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can tell people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was the last time you would get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and for businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow up to valuing their entire person, valuing the individuality, and diversity, the <unk>
We have to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
So to make a difference in the real world, let's make them be out of the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they see that they will never be seen as they are, or to reach out what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are in your mind?
A <unk>
A <unk>
A <unk>
Her <unk> To his <unk>
Could it just be the woman who is at two miles away. What would it mean for her if he was released from that <unk> voice in his interior, which was given to him for not having long legs -- <unk> more <unk> a flat belly -- smaller <unk>
What would it mean for her if we did this and we would call it the potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession with our culture with the images are actually attached to all.
But let's turn our children to the truth.
I think the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
It empowers the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and we compare to other people.
And we went together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a age year of today, will become agents of safe change agents tomorrow.
So let's just do it.
The five November 1990s, a gentleman called <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed by the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
<unk> initially said, naive, but he was imprisoned by other charges in the company of others, they started planning attacks about 12 icons of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans were driven by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't be <unk>
Later on, he would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer, with a <unk> mother, teacher to elementary school among the two they did everything for giving me happy.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims come to meet.
I saw that when people take time to interact with, it doesn't need a lot to get to wish the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in all human group, there's always a little fraction of people who are going to become so <unk> to their convictions that think that we need to use all the possible means so that everyone lived like them.
A few months before he arrest me and explained to me and explained that in the last weekends, he and some friends, had been going to put shot in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched my father -- my father helped me hold my <unk> on my shoulder and explained how to point to about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot at the little light of the goal and to surprise you, especially me, all of me, all the aim broke out.
My uncle became the other and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
From such a father, such a son.
All of all, the comment was a lot of laugh. But just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned to put them with 700 pounds of explosives in the southern parking lot in the World Trade Center causing a explosion that killed six people and she blew up to other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times, that instability during my childhood didn't allow me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone was now time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always me the new face of the class, it was often <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white. But it will be the new of the class, quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was sitting at home reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, so that was <unk> <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
It was opera, <unk> judge people, based on <unk> indicators like race or religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that put in test my way to think was during election presidential elections.
In a <unk> program I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group went into the subject of juvenile violence -- as I had been victim <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids we had done friendship, was Jewish age.
I took a number of days to get out of light, and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly, I was very proud to have beat the barrier that all life had been made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job, in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
The whole life had been taught me that <unk> was a sin and, for extension, all gay men were bad <unk>
I happened to have the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, he developed a sense of empathy towards suffering from others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people, exactly the way I wish I would be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught as a kid, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that of being homosexual but I know what is being judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me be honest with my <unk> and helped me see that the race of the people, religion or sexual orientation. You have nothing to do with character.
In many ways he became my shape <unk> at a moment when I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way of thinking, and she told me something I keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough of endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is about taking the violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, than even though I was encouraged to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism talking, against those <unk> with no sense, like rejection to the actions of my father.
With this simplicity I put in here as proof that violence is not inherent for any religion or race, that the children don't have to follow the roads of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
At this point, there is a film that is projects in its minds.
It's an incredible movie <unk>
It's 3D and it has <unk> sound that you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like your childhood moments that you project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a superimposed voice on your form of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in directly.
This film is your <unk> of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an inner film film, you, you and you.
There's nothing going to be more directly.
At least, I know I have an awareness of your own.
I have no certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason for living.
If you weren't aware of anything in our lives, it would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these <unk> movies.
Why are we not just robots that we have, what we get to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate the awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective of it.
<unk> for nature, is subjective <unk>
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the entire 20th century, I would get that vision.
<unk> psychology is studying behavioral behavior, and the neuroscience is a <unk> brain, but no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
It was like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science to bring the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the search for correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot better, for example, brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of watching faces or feeling or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work in neuroscience is saying some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. So questions about what they make certain areas of the brain and what they get to do.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> to <unk>
There's really no easy problem with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real central mystery of this <unk> Why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an inner internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of the emerging behaviors, how do they operate the <unk> how they work, how they are going to adapt to their living organisms -- they're all questions about the target work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors, and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we speak, how we play <unk> all of these are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are among easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it's all accompanied with an experience of <unk>
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, is actually still not a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that work. For a long time, I would beat my head on the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end of the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we would get involved in this point.
We have a wonderful string of explanations   We have used to this; physics explains chemistry, explains chemistry, explains biology, explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to seat that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate into our view of the world, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that are going to be crazy before being able to deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Your crazy idea is that there's no such hard problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the Real subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain the functions in the brain -- the behaviors of the brain, and it has been studying everything that is <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me, and for many others, that vision is quite close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental <unk> space, time and mass.
It will be fundamental laws that are defined as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of the most basic thing.
On the contrary, they look principles, and that's what the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, <unk> law, the U.S. laws -- so I applied the basic laws of <unk> and I applied the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are <unk>
I think that's the situation we find in consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space -- time, time, <unk> <unk> then for a question of logic, you have to write the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly not be the object of science.
It opens the path for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, time, time, the mass, the <unk> processes.
<unk> sometimes say that we want to do fundamental laws that can be able to fit them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all, <unk> by the mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the flies, even the microbes from Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are intelligent or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with anguish.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, that's not.
But thinking is that maybe photons can have some kind of crude sense of feeling <unk> a random precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How do you think something so <unk>
And part of this comes from the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that will explore thinking with the physical process, is to restore consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information processing -- there's consciousness.
<unk> complex <unk> as in a human being, complex awareness.
<unk> simple information, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration called <unk> which measures the level of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to <unk> it has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a kind of information integration of information, but pretty significant, rather important.
But when you get to those worms -- microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller -- but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a level of <unk> consciousness level.
In fact, offers a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate the awareness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the below.
How explains Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire come from?
From <unk> vision, the physics of physics can leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists actually do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not being outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision I think, <unk> vision has the potential to address our relationship to nature, and it can have very serious ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hunger.
I think if I think about it, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact that consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they do do some pretty serious ethical problems about the ethic of development systems and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group, such an integrated group, as the audience in a TED Talk, we have a TED consciousness, an internal film for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question you must take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision -- and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually safer in the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is the second thing that is universal.
Now, vision raises a lot of questions, so many challenges, like, how these bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we finally will be able to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a <unk> profile.
I went to school, I fell into my friends, I was stuck with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's really nice -- but there is a problem.
She has actually no anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a breath in the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered a achievement if we took the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the middle class of studies -- a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when you give your <unk>
I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law enforcement for about good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk>
When people in the wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
"Of course, in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people as objects of inspiration.
And we don't. And it's not the <unk> I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire me.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you, right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid I'm afraid, <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they were lied to disabilities.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with disability with disability you do.
It's not something wrong and you can't do a <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more of this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the little girl without the hands with a pencil held with a <unk>
You may have seen a child running with a carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because it <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we would encourage the disabled to benefit from people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and say, "Well, for very bad that my life could be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I have lost the number of times that I've been dealing with strange <unk> to express that you think I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this would happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like if I was getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images led to people with disability to benefit from people without disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually difficult.
We have a few things.
But the things that we <unk> are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> to deliberately because I believe myself called the social model of <unk> which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live than our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
It makes things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of common.
They are simply using their bodies by taking out the best of their ability.
So is it really right in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you like a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because they have sold this lie that disability makes us exceptional with us.
And honestly don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "For God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by something for me?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm lucky to them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to load the battery battery into the battery battery.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really think that the lie that have been sold to disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that is lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles at a range of stairs has never done it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> in front of a television screen, I'm not going to make the subtitles for people <unk>
Nor do a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and they would give a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered <unk> of anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people who have disability to be <unk> by stepping out of bed and remember our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where the genuine achievement of the people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where the 11 degree in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think about what you think about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and the professional <unk> with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I just respond to one of those questions, so please, don't go down.
When people think actually <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to try to go.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would match your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what it's running through the game of the game of 160 <unk> blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds -- we were trying to do it with all of their self.
I've been there and I assure you, it's nothing nice.
I would take some videos to show you what is to use the Google <unk> under the hull, and give them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the emerging technology <unk> is an submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
So I would get a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that we need to have people the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, being their favorite <unk> and they've been asked on YouTube and in <unk> "You can see from the angle of a <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get to <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that I certainly have a lot already.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why with this video video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a roller coaster for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before running and making a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running the ball on the bottom of the network?  Or do it <unk> making a cash in <unk>
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality <unk> when <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So, here's a quick refresher on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore were put in a <unk> to her <unk> and play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to do it.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> placed radios on the <unk> of <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming into your group and you see your next move in front of you, in a plastic display of plastic that you carry on board -- you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or for memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose games like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But the augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the high of the people that's below.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad will have the information <unk>
This is going to make good teams of the bad teams.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being just for nerds.
It will also be for <unk> Who would have <unk>
What would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
<unk> the ball and <unk>
So let's go on an open receptor. All of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Normally, you don't get it, but the system of <unk> will be <unk>
It takes the area of protection.
Another <unk> you will tell you that there's a open receptor.
Did you get the <unk> but you get <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land yet, the receptor sees in your bombsight an area of grass that lights up and it can change the career.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed the move from every angle.
This is something to create massive emotion.
I'm going to do lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
You want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality is <unk> because it's too profitable for not to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to support the empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in another person's place.
We know what this technology is worth of <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology worth of a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they're living <unk>
So how much is it worth for a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality comes close.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, we face ourselves as always, of us.
Thank you.
I recently got stuck after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago, I spent the south end of the County <unk> that includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean -- and its inspirational architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> an Austrian head of building the bridge said that "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will bring it to another dimension, this bridge has gone down as such, so the fall of it releases you from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one drop of four to five seconds, the body hits about 120 miles per hour.
The shock <unk> in the bones, some of which are vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that no, they normally fall into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that that <unk> this suicide method will notice about the <unk> death of death <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are before they get their lives.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is at that edge, and at its darker time, it's very hard to bring you back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had successful that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
You know, we can channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those that we were going to die for suicide, but officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him on September 22 last year when they receive a call of a suicide <unk> sitting on the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to a passenger officer named <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had flown up here two times before from New Jersey to try to kill himself from this bridge.
After about an hour of talking to <unk> I wondered if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, "We never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
Out of her came out, <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open up the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped about <unk> leaned on to the right, and he left.
I was this kind and clever man in New Jersey had just taken out of life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how it was.
The parents of Jason had been order.
<unk> collateral damage affects a lot of people.
I would pose these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved being <unk>
What <unk>
What does that mean?
In my experience, it's not just to talk about, but you have to listen.
Listening to understanding.
I'm not <unk> or say to the person who you know how it feels like, because I probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask ask the question is, are you going to be thought about the end of my life, you've had these <unk>
It empowers the person in front, you can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believing that things are terrible and they're never going to succeed, but they never have anything that you can do to <unk> social isolation and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and would like to read you your letter.
She lost his son the 19th of January this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he was with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realization that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of 49 <unk> with his father the 19th of January.
He never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the car Mike was down on the bridge.
A witness I had seen it jumping from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without suffering a true mental illness.
It must be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The Golden Golden Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 of March 2005, I wrote to a radio call for a <unk> subject -- on the front page of the bridge near the north.
I was going on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he immediately crossed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and the next half of the next time, I heard like Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account to go back to that lane and give the life another opportunity.
When Kevin stepped back, it <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was the thing that he did that he did to <unk> and gave the hope and another <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
And you let me talk to you and just let me go.
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to take it to you.
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the 11 o'clock events, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin keeps on with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I was able to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as it says.
We thank God for you.
I really <unk> with you, <unk> <unk>
And in the end, she wrote, <unk> -- when I visited San Francisco General at the night, you were <unk> as the patient.
<unk> I know I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is an active father and an active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something that I've found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk>
That act, despite finishing its own pain, I'm going to be an opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide does.
For most people who are <unk> or those who believe the suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own pain to be.
Normally this is actually achieved by three things: to sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and suicide calls around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly involved involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who was talking about about an hour.
For that time, I got my hand back at three times.
On the end of the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, these few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second thing you leave out the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't just connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each one of us should work for doing.
suicide can be prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but you know what you are, but you know what you are, and a question is, how do you get in that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt I had finally achieved the dream that I had since I was a child.
My outside was finally <unk> in my inner truth, with my inner myself.
So by complicated reasons, that I'm going to go over later, when I look at this picture, I think, managed to put it up, put it up with it.
But last October, I discovered that I am early on.
We all <unk> our families, our society, our society, our society -- even our bodies.
Some of them have the value value to get rid of the constraints of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
These are people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent, even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
They recorded me as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember at five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always wore this t-shirt in my head.
And my mom was going, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never helped me to share my story, not because I thought to be a bad thing, but how the world is all the people who want to <unk>
Every day, I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who gets me like I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture, celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
And I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if I got married, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a revolutionary beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> <unk>
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for the <unk> and <unk> and that night, he won in a bath, he won her <unk> and she was a third finalist of over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first work was about queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> goddess especially when they went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, called me and I told me that the request of the green card could be going to live in the U.S.
I was hooked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you get to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I would put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was watching myself in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand will do the most sophisticated sophisticated and secure.
In that time in the U.S., it was necessary for surgery before they changed the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license, and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be a model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living alive was living in his truth, but he was able to end his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 November, we make a global vigil for <unk> Day.
I am on this stage because of a long history of people who are <unk> and stood up for injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth alone and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, and fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer any more <unk> than 20 <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. Now, thank you first, to thank all my <unk>
My support network, my parents especially, my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have been to young women who have been called, and sometimes when they called me and they told me that his parents couldn't take it, he took the phone, he calls my mom and said, "Mommy, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- it's not just gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender at birth, and what I try to do is to put on the table that sometimes that <unk> <unk> and there should be a space that would allow people to go, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The gay movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be room for curiosity and asking questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. <unk> Thank you.
In many societies, tribal societies, the parents generally know about their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when they had their efforts in 2011, to the <unk> National <unk> of peace, became very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality of violence and exploitation.
You see, in Muslim-majority societies right from the beginning, when at birth a little girl, their birth will not be <unk>
It's not dancing, not for his father, and his mother.
And the neighborhood comes out, gives their <unk> to the mother, and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot to have a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of one child, when he was born, she was going to feel guilty like a criminal.
Not only the mother was suffering, but the daughter. The <unk> daughter, when it grows, too.
At the age of five, when I should go to school, you get home and the school admits of her brothers.
Even the age of 12 years in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move around the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes in adolescence, when it was 13 years old, he is banning out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes a so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family and his family, and if he looked at the code of that of <unk> it could even kill.
And it's interesting that this code of honor, is not just affecting the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of her sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one more standard rule of societies called <unk>
A good girl should be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and embracing people's decisions and mother and women's decisions even if they don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like it or if I read it with an old man, you have to <unk> because you don't want to be <unk>
If the very young one, it has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then it gives birth to more and more <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> her daughter and the same lesson for his children.
And this vicious cycle goes on and continues.
I was like, brothers and sisters, when I was born and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I was thinking, I was fascinated by his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half, I was in my school.
You might be wondering, why should I mention a kid in a school?
Yeah, I have to <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies in tribal societies, it's a great event that was a young event.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of your identity and his name.
<unk> means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when we had a tourist <unk> and I was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason that I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters not to her daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I would sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to hide in his personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and girls for the same.
I used education for <unk>
I went to my daughters, taught the students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation in all of the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
girls were banned at school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> girls' girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10, <unk> got up and got up the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper on the BBC, he offered her himself for the documentaries New York Times, and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and the nine October of 2012, was shot at <unk> on the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he would lie to my wife -- "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please, don't stop you?"
Take the fair cause.
You spend your life in play because of the cause of peace, and because of the course of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and get paid.
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words would be a lot for me, and I didn't ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital, and I had strong headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter will never <unk>
I used to <unk> "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to give you good -- please, not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for children of children and women, it's like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when you don't just run your task.
They fight her siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What are there especially in my mentoring that has made so audacious to <unk> and brave and <unk>
I tell you, I don't ask what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut its wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> in the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined my <unk> group of Google, where I had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google X. But the whole work I'm talking about here about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you hit a brain surgery.
You're still just like intelligent or not?
It's not going to be like that, you'll be <unk>
After <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, of more powerful chemical powerful chemicals every day, because if it didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to figure out the combinations and mixing them from chemicals and try to deal with them to follow alive.
More than I have saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul from <unk> so I decided that I would take to try to get the dose, that it really doesn't have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I began to try with different mixes and I was surprised by looking at how small changes in the dose we would dramatically drop -- my sense of who I am, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a regular dose for a class man, and I was surprised by looking at how my thoughts are.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several types of types -- or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit of <unk> to fix a problem that had the front, and it just wasn't going like that.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and what they have to do -- I've been better from then I get better with men.
And what was trying to do is that these hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was to reclaim my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my thinking -- my creative thinking -- my kind of ideas.
We would think almost always in images, and that became my key point of reference -- how do I get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> it will be new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the minds works, for me is simple for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to thinking <unk> and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> really <unk> rather sophisticated <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental pictures, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use its imagination only to steer the world to the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were conducted by two groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image in order to represent the brain. Here you can see the brain scan conducted by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The <unk> column shows the brain scan of that same individual as they were <unk> by seeing that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated by many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine that the same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from <unk> Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
So in this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube videos as they were taking their brains to create a large range of reactions in the brain to the video sequences in the video.
Then they showed them a new film with new, new people, new animals, and as long as a new <unk>
The computer using only the brain information called the scan of the scanning to show what seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This blew us out.
We're just close to this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same image, and when you imagine that same image, it creates in the brain the same <unk>
This took place with the major brain scanning systems available today, and its resolution as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you get it?
There are lots of techniques to do it.
One is to open up your skull and introduce electrodes.
I can't offer that one.
Many are proposing new techniques of projection for images, even me, <unk> with the recent result of MRI -- we need to ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with larger magnets but at this point, more <unk> they offer little improvements in the resolution, not increasing by thousands and we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger magnets making better magnets.
We can create a lot more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make really big magnets right?
But the majority of the recent advances in <unk> of brilliant and brilliant solutions in coding and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> radio frequency <unk>
At the same time, instead of a magnetic field they suck out of magnetic field, state-owned patterns at the frequencies of radio radio.
So when we combine these patterns with magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio processing processing processing processing processing -- we can increase in mass form, the information that you can get in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide our growing knowledge of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned -- maybe even neural activity -- this is sleep.
We're going to be able to put our ideas in direct ways to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure for Alzheimer's disease and similar diseases.
We have a few more choices to open up this door.
Anyway, let's choose one year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it'll take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you this night about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet not alone.
I think we all have <unk>
Your self may be telling some person for the first time that she loves or telling somebody who's pregnant, or telling somebody who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have to get through life.
I all get a hard conversation -- and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet something universal is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I worked in the South Side -- I was working in the South Side of the city, and I was there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be <unk> from my <unk> and I would have fallen my pants on a little bit, I would usually ask you -- I would usually ask a kid to say, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And he would appear to be a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I put my jaw a little bit, I would take my coffee with a leave of <unk>
The father said, <unk> the newspaper and mother tossed a cold, look at her son.
But I would not tell you anything, and go through it.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three to 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time would say something.
So that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
It's a family silence, but this time was about to get into the women's issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues" that we had.
And so I took a deep breath, and I got my back and my back a four year-old girl with a pink dress -- looking at it, which is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> <unk> a little girl with a question: "You're kid or <unk>
And so I took it very much again, I got out of <unk> near her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like the one boy, and I saw clothes, but I'm a girl, and I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
Now, I'm more than a girl from a ninja pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all -- OK. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know how color the walls.
You just know how a feeling feels living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I would give you 100 reasons why I get out of my closet that I get out of my closet that it was harder to get out of his, but this is the <unk> It's hard to do it.
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to somebody who has declared in banking banking is harder than telling it that it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is more difficult than telling your <unk> child you're going to <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there is only the hard thing.
We need to let us figure out what makes us hard for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make it feel security, or at least security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what their walls are made is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine themselves 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse, a horse, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It was not the militant lesbian prepared to fight every child in four years who would walk into coffee.
I was frozen because I was <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay, and I just move only a muscle is the most scary thing ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers with whom I've spent my whole life trying not to <unk> and now the world would turn back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of an script that we've all been following for so long, but if you don't throw that <unk> to you.
One of my most memorable launches was on my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests were invited to know that was gay, and when I had my <unk> <unk> and I was standing around the tables and I finally got around the tables and I finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew me was years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women I screamed at, <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having a <unk>
<unk> what's your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who we are <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but trying to show desperately his support, to make me know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like you have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're authentic to somebody, you have to be prepared for how authentic it is.
That's how hard conversations remain hard to be my strong point.
Ask anybody with whom I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it means to get out of any universe is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> the <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> others must know that we also do suffer.
Number two: Be a direct <unk> just <unk> its <unk>
If you know that they're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate to your truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of you can get out wounded and safe <unk> for what they've done, but never be sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not yours with them.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark package, you have a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very <unk> but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen intelligence -- a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question if a machine can think of it is as interesting as the question of whether an submarine can be solved.
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critique of computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, we would take a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
So let's take a step back.
We start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from an alien while that you don't know anything about the biology of the Earth or the Earth or the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from an alien race that doesn't know about this, that it doesn't have any concept about intelligence on Earth, you would look compelled to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to some point in time, the asteroids that are going to take up the surface of a <unk> planet stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question of understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted a number of years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines that I think, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be carefully honed for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that we overestimate the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in planning movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I said, from course several years ago, there is an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can get from all these different <unk>
Is there just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence I've ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is an affirmation that intelligence is a strength, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or maintain the open options with a force -- with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yes, to an impending imminent <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain the open.
And so if you consider this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the human intelligence level.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, I'll show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that make more mess, or <unk> during their life should be available to more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence is a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually comes directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that is found inside.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple animal intelligence testing to play games, and even earn money <unk> actions, all of it without being told to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human here -- here we see <unk> automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance has apps for humanoid robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate just pulling opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a model version of that task.
This ability to cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For instance, here we see this successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, preserving their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections into a social network where friends are constantly getting together and keeps the net well connected.
This same power capacity of network also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the pathways of a fleet of boats, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to expand its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a <unk> strategy.
This risk service will have huge applications in finance and insurance skills.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of smart cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, and walking upright and social cooperation flow from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the use of the term -- the labor -- there was always the concept that if you had smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion in it.
The machines were <unk> against us.
One of the biggest implications of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion <unk> in reverse.
It's not that machines get smart, and then they try and take over the world.
It's anything else that the impulse to take control of all the future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence can actually be coming out directly from taking control, rather than the other way.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, "How is it that you can look for targets but from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants to help help build artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence, to help us understand human intelligence, the intelligence has to be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we have expanded our knowledge to how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The NASA mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points that the Earth is only one of the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope, which measures the faint intensity of the stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they tested a little bit of that light to get us.
The data gathered by Kepler show the sizes of planets besides the distance between them and their mother.
And together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their teeth.
At its time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hottest record.
<unk> and sea ice that has been with us since millennia, are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused on a global scale have gone through our ability to alter its course.
But I'm not a weather scientist and I am not <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone who is very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more like our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet.
Let's take our neighbor to Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world that is shown by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track its surface in search of clues about the origins of life as well as we know it.
<unk> satellites like the <unk> mission take samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now offer not just short space flights but also the possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images, <unk> remind us of the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still going to be <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and higher places on Earth is cool and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I'm worried that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets will drag up with a big and sad thing, and the implication of some that Mars is waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that is truly livable the Earth.
As long as I like my exploration, I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars is going to be there to help humanity is like to imagine that the captain of the Titanic is to imagine that the <unk> really will have place later in the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration and land preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and to improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
Only you find them closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain space <unk> in the hostile areas and land on the ground, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with a <unk> experiment.
A lot of years ago, Enrico Enrico art, I said, considering our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life to now.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider to continue to live between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the planets were to build this development.
It's arrogant to think that just the colonization we will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and educational preservation can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to address the hostile environments of Mars for the human presence, so we should be able to overcome the easiest task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I got my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I had no keys.
In fact, I could see in the window that they were at the table in the dining table, where there was <unk>
So I tried to open up all the other doors and windows, and all they were pretty cool.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I could not go home from my friend of Jeff to pass night, because I had one early flight to Europe after the next morning, and I got my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but sure that they not more expensive than a <unk> half night, so I thought, well, in the circumstances, I thought that despite the circumstances that were well over.
I'm a profession a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that your heart rate goes up to the heart rate -- they will restore the levels of adrenaline and <unk> thinking.
And when I arrived at the counter <unk> at the airport, I realized I had no passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that could do, systems that could put in his place, which was going to be bad things.
Or at least if things happen, bad things are going to do, the likelihood that it's a total catastrophe here.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts are not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who was a little embarrassed he told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> retrospective <unk>
It's something he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come up and trying to figure out what came out wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you could get wrong, then it tries to figure out what can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with obvious things.
In the house, they took a place for things that are very easily <unk>
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science supporting this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to keep track of the location of the important things, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the trees are, where the trees live -- where the female tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that lets you find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that mechanism very evolved in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not so good for things that move too much.
This is the reason for losing your car keys, reading and <unk>
So at home, you get a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular drawer for him.
For your reading, a particular <unk> in particular.
If you take a place and you're <unk> with it your stuff is always going to be there when you get them.
What about <unk>
Take with your cell phone card, a picture of your credit license, you're <unk> by mail in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases your heads.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved person, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of medical decisions, and in fact for the decision-making and financial decisions and any kind of decision that you have to take from which would benefit rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab, and the cholesterol result is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most competitive drugs in the world today, even if you are likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask that most doctors don't want to speak -- and the pharmaceutical companies are even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or have surgery on any medical procedure before you can help a person.
And you have to think of what kind of statistical statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a doctor, and if it's somebody else's fault -- it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the mechanisms.
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This is according to the research research on the cynical research <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I myself explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, or another <unk> event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everyone <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistical statistic and it is, let's stop the effects of <unk> Right?
For this particular drug, in particular, the side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> of muscle pain and <unk> pain.
But a moment.
remember, under stress don't think very clearly.
So think about how you can do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 are side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out of the drug will help you the drug.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
<unk> credit ethic is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value value of the crash, but actually this number needs to treat is quite typical.
To the surgery that is more done in the top men in the 50 percent of the prostate cancer, the number you need to deal with is <unk>
This is, 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case is produced by 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you have luck and it's one of that 50 percent effects just took one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think about time before the questions that you can argue that we will make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter life that you want to be shorter in pain, or a longer life that could have a lot to the end?
These are the things they talk about, and they think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change from opinion in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that it shut down a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
So on face with a predator with a predator, you don't need the immune system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism on those things, it doesn't react quickly. They might be the lunch lunch. So none of it matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the logical logical thought -- like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to be able to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail sometimes.
The idea is to think of the future how those <unk> could be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help you to minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> at night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor settled on a combination of combination next to the door, with a key to the front door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards I haven't ordered -- and lots of email messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not really organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: It was my favorite favorite symbol of musical music.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more gentle <unk>
Two more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there it looks like it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be -- I would never get a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the story of the American system of sign -- the <unk> besides a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the decade of <unk> and over the time over time, they mixed with local, and developed the language we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for nothing.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, they're actually in my mind every day.
As a person who lives who lives in a sound world, is like I lived in a foreign country, to follow blindly by their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms of <unk>
So how do I understand the one?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people answers.
So I've learned, for example ...
"I don't deserve the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure not <unk> <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of sound.
And I'm always waiting for you, the sound is to come next.
From there, this drawing.
You decide.
It's going to be continuing to continue.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines contain sounds through <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
And yet, for me, doing whatever my thumb looks natural.
That's why I have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic home there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited in museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, it was all <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
I'm going to tell you more about art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not just experiences through the ears.
I can feel that <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the property ownership and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had been taught me in the sound, I decided to leave it and get it.
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention that I had.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> was something of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that I could get to me and my artistic work, or I could tell you.
I chose to help me.
There's a massive culture of around modern language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, at work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when I asked <unk> his voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value something like taking a loan in a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could be able to do it at <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't capture and completely express on the paper.
And the same thing can be said about a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means subtle changes can affect all of the meaning as much as signs of the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you get better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> divide into many different <unk> different things.
If you <unk> a different parameter different for every finger as you play the piano, like facial expression, the speed, the shape of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand, and so as the piano, the piano, the English is a linear language, as if it's <unk> just a key at a time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> they need the 10 fingers in the way to express a clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If I just would change the chord -- would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens to the music in terms of <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters you can express different ideas.
So for example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I'm <unk>
EV: oh.
What are you <unk>
Oh, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the music?
If I had to create a sign and fold it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and put it in.
This is all day."
If you break it down, and you shake the speed, visually speed, you see as a piece of music.
All the day.
I feel like the same thing can be said to <unk> the <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, on this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- <unk> <unk>
I feel like the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time in <unk> and how distance your body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one that is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea, at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk> at <unk>
Watch <unk> right hand, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of the hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do this with me?
All with the very high hands.
Now we're going to do it so much in your head like chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> at the same time."
Yeah, great.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages around the world.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please get back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how the three signs are very similar. They all happen on your head and the chest and they make very different meanings here.
It's amazing to see how <unk> live and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have any sound automatically -- it doesn't have social value.
We have to start to question what defines social value and allow us to grow its own value, without sounds.
And this might be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> and you don't have to hear the music.
<unk> is a treasure trove of mine, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to try to open up his ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
You never know, you can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you take everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a innocence of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I must say, because adults would lie to us to protect ourselves from the awful truth.
When I became older -- I found out that adults also <unk> and they're not very good at cleaning up the others.
Now the country, now I'm an adult and I teach citizen and invention in <unk> Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait for my students to walk around the beach with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, cleaned up <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, and we have these bits of plastic <unk> to get those bits of plastic to study it under the microscope, and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts to an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive and it's also very risky and it's going to be able to use those enormous <unk>
So along with my students, ages six to 15 years, we dream about inventing a better way.
We have transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> job with <unk> so that children are very <unk> they can also participate.
And they will tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas out of every child and try to engage them in something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the children would get a lot to the robots.
And then we actually created what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned the web and the web camera in accessories. And they put it into a floating robot that will get slowly around the water and by plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
And I put this invention on a step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else will do it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to come up right away.
I was able to investigate my <unk> <unk> But my students in Hong Kong are children very well informed.
You see the news news, you see the Internet, and you get stuck with this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years ago, cleaning a oil spill, just using your hands, in <unk> the world's largest Amazon rainforest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is attached to where the place they live.
You can also see the water is brown, mud and oil are also brown color, and when it's all <unk> it's very hard to see what there is in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what there is in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help you identify what is in the water.
So we took this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was forced to do a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit more far, maybe I might address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I am half Japanese and French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that triggered several giant waves of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant of Fukushima, a nuclear center close to water.
And today, according to the reports an average of 300 tons are still filtering out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast of the Japanese coast, and the majority, in the moment, is all about blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the crash and researching independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the children.
Of course, not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night I went to the center of <unk> you see the use of different masks on it.
It could seem like they didn't take work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with the <unk> all his life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talked about what we were going to make next, <unk> <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive dust will be <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organized an civil expedition, the closest to the nuclear central to date.
We are approaching a quarter of a mile from nuclear center, and with the fishermen of the <unk> we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a tracking device that we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem.
And it has been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit small therefore, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the largest space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood metal -- metal -- a little bit of biology, and you basically can build almost everything around there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become with help from adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, can we invent the future of mobility with <unk>
So for example.
Or, we can help in mobility of the advanced age transforming their standard wheelchair into new self-driving vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists, creators, <unk> we have to prepare the next generation for us to worry about the environment and the people, and so it can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other one I thought so.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said when he looked at the raw, he saw a figure that was fighting to be free.
<unk> was only Miguel <unk>
But the living creatures are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, cells, we took all of the information it took it for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects as <unk> of different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pore.
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One acts mainly as filter the other mostly as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there is no place, no <unk>
It's a system that takes gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents the <unk> of every designer and an architect in the working currently between the <unk> and the gene between the machine, and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and synthetic analysis shows on the two screens behind me.
My job in its simplest level, it's about bringing these two visions of the world, moving from the assembly and getting to growth.
You probably ask yourselves why now?
Why wasn't it possible about it 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment where they connect four disciplines that offers designers that offer access to the tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through large-scale scales, like this robotic arm with a <unk> range of diameter with a tool that is not very far out to print buildings called <unk> and graphics made by genetically genetically altered <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where each of the future is unique size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for a <unk> fashion of Paris with <unk> they're <unk> it's like a second <unk> skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing <unk> we printed this layer and 3D <unk> no seams in the cells. I'm going to show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and soft materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner called <unk>
That designers have access to this high resolution <unk> and the <unk> instruments allows it to design products that are <unk> not just the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair, a chair to the very comfortable structural and also absorb sound.
The Carter professor came back to nature to <unk> and to design this pattern of <unk> <unk> becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, they vary its functionality not through the addition of another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material property.
But is nature <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I grew up in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them was left and defined a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a tree, <unk> <unk>
For that first tree, there would be no difference between trunk, the leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land did grow trees with branches, cortex, water and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design be if the objects were made of a single piece?
Would you have a better state of the <unk>
So we look for that material <unk> the kind of material in the <unk> tree with fruit -- and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune into their properties, we could generate <unk> structures.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  We asked a lot of seed <unk> the <unk> and we produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of material over the march and create these structures made of a single three three material material -- 100 percent recyclable material.
When the pieces are <unk> it breaks down to find a natural shape in touch with the air.
So why do we continue to design with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process that was used to contain <unk> <unk> which appeared on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the genetically engineered bacteria to capture quickly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of <unk> to mesh, and if it extends even further, a windows.
A tree, fruit flies.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little synthetic biology, we have transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp on an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for <unk> objects in the sea, put their life together, and put it on the ground, they'll grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility to create clothes to keep life <unk>
To do that, we need to master the bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> <unk> we made our own <unk> <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made out of <unk> and <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- new biological importance inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops -- <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
A convert light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> are not interacting in nature.
In fact, they never have <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to hold these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the tract tract that will help you <unk> these bacteria and make their function of way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, we will have the properties of material as it is that functionality <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> we would make more transparent channels.
This digestive system, when you stretch from one end to another, it takes 60 feet.
This is half the length of a soccer field and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with brilliant life within the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are working earlier -- only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that would make our skin <unk> the tissue abuse and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material stuff.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer made material <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which it was <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two different proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, which fibers put those fibers together.
And this is happening through scales.
The silk worm first turn into the environment, creates a structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
<unk> and <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a little magnet to the head of a worm worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when you put silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we would take a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different environments -- different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
Often they <unk> the silk worms to death inside its <unk> its silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates and we can shape the raw silk with no boiling <unk>
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we got this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making templates and we put it on our site.
We knew that <unk> silk worms to <unk> and <unk> so we use a solar road diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, <unk> the silk worms over the structure.
We were prepared to get to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> silk silk <unk>
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to be prepared with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk on silk <unk> <unk> give this whole pavilion this integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry -- this is the length of the path of silk.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other big empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form a ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a inspired design in nature in nature inspired by us, for the first time, that we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked them, "What do you want to be <unk>
If they had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can stick with your fingers.
Five. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school, I liked English, and <unk> and art and place in websites -- also playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And they generally like to test and persist anyway, because having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is not a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I was excited about something else, something totally different, and I'm going to stand up with it, and I feel <unk> I have found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to let it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing to deny all of my passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad about me is not going to be <unk> at all.
I was worried about to be afraid of engagement, or being dispersed, or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked me then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you do it, they learned from culture.
So we asked ourselves, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what it was at that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of <unk> here.
So this question is done over and over again as we grow in various ways, you know, <unk> to high school students are asking them to choose in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before what the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream with what might be, not inspire to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, right now, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though adults are good <unk> maybe they are <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk> -- and he is <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative director.
But most children don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each one of us has something to do to do in this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected in this way?
What happens if there are a lot of different issues that wake up with a lot of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone as one in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feeling something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so to say.
It could help if you divide into three parts: multiple <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms with the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the time, the ideal was the ideal one was the one who was well involved in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
Do you have any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we cannot agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or distress that you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, we travel, mathematics and design, when we found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
By <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
Hence the new ideas come from.
And <unk> with all their background, they can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower is learning fast.
When we put them in <unk> we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we are less afraid to test things and get out of our zones of comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> other disciplines and we bring everything we've learned to every new zone that we need, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a complete <unk> and <unk>
As an amazing piano girl, <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it became a writer, he was <unk> financial was <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales of sales when he was starting their practices -- and this ability helps to write compelling suggests for the editors.
It's rarely a waste of time to go to what you would give to you, even if at the end of the end, we would get it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge into a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower superpower, is the adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, but sometimes volunteering as a website, sometimes consultant of Kickstarter, sometimes a <unk> and sometimes James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> Company <unk> defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that are able to meet the market needs to meet the market needs of the market, the ones that actually <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that might be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a big interest in encourage the <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need no conventional creative thinkers to address them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> from the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams get up from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive into a depth and put ideas into practice, and the <unk> offers an idea of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that we are connected to how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> most of them are told to be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there is one thing you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the inner wiring is whatever it is.
If you are a heart of heart, then you can go through all the media.
That's where you give the best one.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
The intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world to us.
Thank you.
In the year we had a woman named <unk> and led to a psychiatric psychiatric disease.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until it passed away from <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of <unk> of a guy who never seen before.
But even more surprising.
If you were going to have been living in my life today, we couldn't give it more help than he was going to <unk> he gave him <unk>
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> a lot of treatments for cancer, antiretroviral them to HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been progress on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which by the way, include many of you.
If you expect to live to 85 years or more, the ability to get Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of each of the two of each of them.
In other words, there is the probability that your years will spend with Alzheimer's or helping care of a friend or want to get Alzheimer's.
In America, Alzheimer's care about 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs -- a <unk> increase in the year by 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be able to cure or even slow their development.
We do understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research that is in Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more disease and causes a number of <unk> deaths from deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to one more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people know, but the whole world, Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last couple of years, all of us -- even, scientists, given Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain brain compared to the Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's growth significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds right, these dots are coming inside the inside.
But sometimes things come out wrong, and some points are going to be on the outside.
So this makes the molecules that are <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of Alzheimer's patients.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are lots of steps, and the identifying one of the <unk> is complex, as a bomb <unk>
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the pump <unk>
You have to find the right step that we can do, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the wires and waited the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> <unk> physical, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process -- now it's testing a new kind of drugs that used specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when these drugs happened to be able to <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- you can see that they move with normal.
These maggots, on the other hand, have molecules of protein that stick with each other inside them, like with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see that they were <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive object, but the research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there are real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to tell us that Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and if we fix it, we can <unk>
In the case of other disease, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, the drug industry, and scientists and <unk>
That was essential to advance the HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too excited to get out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimers is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there's 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
I was talking about them talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I took this article in the neocortical column, the <unk> <unk> in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to test it as a night of last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers will come together to get 36 and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you would get to another person?
And <unk>
So we <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number four: <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like to do, or she -- I know very honest about this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say someone you've just known to.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a really really struck detail really called me the attention that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly well -- I didn't expect to be <unk>
But I thought it was a good story, so I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the neocortical column.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you are probably asking yourselves still still yet.
And the reason I think are questioning this is because they've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the paper was published was so nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had told me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog gate can come up with a few hundreds of views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would reach probably a few thousands of view.
And that has a good burden on a relatively new relationship.
But as I gave it no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday at night, and the Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And on Sunday, I had been called the "Today I'm thinking: Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the article received more than eight million views, and I was like, to say something, so little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage the confidence writing with <unk> about own <unk> experience, but another thing is to discover that loving life of one has been international news --  -- and that people all over the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or write it, what they did every day for weeks, always, first the same question: still go together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for the <unk> of my email with the phrase, <unk> follow <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were of students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
I even gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international business, you should expect people to feel comfortable with you asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
Second questions seemed to be <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> who included the readers of the readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all of this focus was really <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both made a public emergence together.
I set up TV interviews, and we <unk> the orders for two photos of us two.
I think it was afraid of becoming the <unk> of the <unk> process, a range of a range that I didn't feel like at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if it was really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce love love, not just a adventure, but love love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially people made the wrong question.
How do you know whether to go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, it would make the experience of doing these 36 questions that are less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in the same study in 1997. And there, the goal of researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, it was looking for interpersonal <unk> among university students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study does work.
The participants were much closer to doing several <unk> and then they were also used renewable protocol -- as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community. And they've used it among people in opposite policies.
The original version of the story, the one that I proved in personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a small art college, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed to be surprised by it.
I said, "Do you want to say that you would love you with the person who is <unk>
Well he did a break.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, "But they became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better better after test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really hard <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what virtually my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I took to science.
And I did everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could somehow be <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just went to research for the book I was writing but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought if I met the romantic love of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel like I was then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand what I after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more of what you can reasonably demand me.
What I'm looking for about love is an instant, not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but that I will continue to be <unk> in the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people were asking when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way for some ways to mitigate the risk of <unk> and this is a very <unk> story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it's about love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that question: are still still together?
And his content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, let's ask that ask more difficult questions, questions like, How does you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How would you be in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live in the doubt of your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more vivid conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the story of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, and I would apply a study designed to create romantic love, we will continue to continue together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
They had fallen in love because we took the choice to be.
And I felt a little bit about reading it now, not because it's not true, but because in the moment, I had not considered everything that choice was.
I didn't think how many times we would have both to make that decision, and how long I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always will choose or not.
I want it to be enough to do and responded 36 questions, I have chosen to love somebody who was so generous, kind and fun and expressed that choice in the largest day in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really understand.
And what I'm going to do, and what maybe I will spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending to implicit in the title of my item, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I actually didn't write of.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's <unk> but that is the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian in full mountain and in a way I got a <unk> of the forest.
And in New York City a time ago,  -- something that really affected me but more detail later.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood and <unk> a dollar bill a dollar, and a <unk> in somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some weird <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our sort of, <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has funny because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from field and do <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took up all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> I was able to get the Agnes Martin, I covered it and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more cast on the canvas, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite: somehow it seemed to increase in size, as if it was that you were going to get the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I began to add some electronic elements, frogs, <unk> that I was finding out the street, everything that I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow out. Let's draw just like a dead dead <unk>
And I took the objects out and created my own taxonomy of specimens from <unk>
First of all, you can get an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started riding exhibits and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in human shape, <unk> sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass sheets, similar to the drawing of a window then on a window and another window, and I had all of these windows together that form a three-dimensional composition of three-dimensional windows.
And this really worked out, and I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work would come with something very big, that I call <unk>
For <unk> I was inspired by a big measure in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 meters long.
It has double faces, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, this <unk> mesh -- where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals of animals are heading on to <unk> lists on the ocean <unk>
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a male god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
But it's also kind of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand gets clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's an aspect of <unk>
It's a bit of a story.
That's the hand in which I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird peak.
It also has a <unk> <unk> a long snake tail that joins the <unk>
But anyway, its tail turn on fire on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go up, you know.
Their tail ends in a <unk> eyeball made from 1986.
They have <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very quickly:
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six years project to do 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material whether it's <unk> dictionaries or robotics.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at a time.
It's like cells, they come together, they come together.
And you can walk between them. I'm taking years.
Each one is basically a microscope microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> he's his chest, you can get off the door.
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of my chest, and it takes the penis or <unk> or whatever it has, a kind of thing <unk>
It's a quick post of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are a few pills coming out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a small forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you be <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a writer, a writer, a school, an editorial arm that spreading all the content we do in the world -- and a garden.
<unk> the box and all of the people inside hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you're <unk> who is and the box in which he's living it.
And together we came to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, from the borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same stuff and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
I'll take a pill out there is the most effective system and <unk> for any drug that you can make in your body.
The <unk> however, is that the <unk> any medication is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially on patients with HIV.
When they take drugs that are <unk> to decrease the amount of viruses in blood, and increase the count of bacterial cells.
But they are also known for their side effects, <unk> mostly negative, because in the time that it takes to get into the current level, they will be <unk> and worse than the time that it takes to get to their destination, which is where it's more important, on the warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph system, the nervous system, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells to infect cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the drugs that is a lifetime treatment for life to run by the oral life.
And one day, I sat up and I thought, "Hey, do we get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> to care wounds and surgery surgery, you can use for anything else -- including the shipping transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open or drill extremely small holes, which open and closed almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce your medicines.
<unk> ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a powerful little ray of laser beam on the cell cell living with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains drugs.
The laser through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even know it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this ongoing technology right now, or at <unk> <unk> but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, goes to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, as the laser uses again to maintain the open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every research researcher in our case, a <unk> treatment.
Thank you.
Over the last decade, I've been studying armed groups and armed groups like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
And what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to violent <unk> nonviolent <unk>
I do the field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a <unk> among states.
Not anymore.
It's now a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> arrangements of 1975 and 2011, <unk> were signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of the resolution of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why we think of how they do it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they didn't go in.
The armed struggle and the policies are not <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
<unk> groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for the violent <unk> against Israel.
From the creation of the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military system.
Similarly, Palestinian Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
It's multitasking
It was a complex machine machine, and radio stations radio stations and radio stations and web websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups also invest in a complex fundraising fund but by doing business -- for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, to increase their funds, to recruit and build their brand.
Race also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population by investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, put in professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
Race are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan torn through the war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated death price for the population.
But in general, provide social services that means filling a <unk> a <unk> divide by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 of Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups, we just think on the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps <unk> for the government, and come up like armed groups, and political groups participate in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated and sophisticated ones are these organizations, we can use it as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It takes part of a territory, they run all of its functions -- they collect the garbage, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations and <unk> and the weak of them are states, like in the Middle East and the <unk> and they fill that divide, non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more than no military tools.
<unk> that governance vacuum has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and strengthen peace.
If we understand better groups -- we will understand better how incentives to encourage the transition from violence to violence is not violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, the military power can make some <unk> but we won't give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these targets we need long-term investments to fill that safety, to fill that <unk> of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm an failure as a woman and a feminist scientist.
My views on gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the openly <unk> label for <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I love it as a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started calling me <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and that we have <unk> as if that was something bad.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, seems like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> that might be a feminist.
It will be labeled <unk> a <unk> a taboo and unpleasant.
I was given as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's the same or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that woman who realizes that it actually is that woman, and it can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
I would take the same wages for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world like <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use it and affordable and accessible services and services.
Do we have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need for <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There are more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in mind our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body -- expression of gender, religion and education, their social condition and much more.
We need to have in account of these differences and how we behave the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist thing.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear rap music, <unk>
Although the letter degrades the women and a dirty way, the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin class, it'd be amazing.
He actually <unk> with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely overwhelmed by my musical music.
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
So let's get rid of the fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies for the fairy tales that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt his husband, his husband, is her choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their kids, they agreed that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this particular choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So we had this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism which has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, gay and gay workers, favor of white women, <unk> and high class.
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist scientist.
It also happens as this: <unk> a <unk>
Do we have this tendency to put feminists <unk> into a <unk>
We expect it to be perfection.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself to get that <unk> before you try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> fear of what that tag means is because I'm afraid I could not be able to fulfill a little realistic expectations.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it. The <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music of 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a show. I see this pop star to see this rock star openly with feminism and to know about women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> time, the cultural critics were having endless debates if they were in terms of a feminist basis.
Would you think about it, rather than just believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot, we need so much.
We go so much beyond the sane and <unk> criticism to <unk> feminism of any woman <unk> until it doesn't get anything.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give it to the action and be a little more <unk>
If I hear music music, I'm creating a demand for artists who would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change in order to make a profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has their music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify an worst choice.
But when bad decisions make this makes it harder for women to achieve equality, equality that all we deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
It's two girls and <unk> and shiny and also very <unk> I want to grow in a world.
And they were scared by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option would be made as much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is all about sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema into another part when movies are not dealing with women as much as objects that are <unk>
Can we stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes are treated their fellow <unk>
In any case, the men, especially men, especially men -- heterosexual men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in your project, or working in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of the people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also help us to be even more than us as we are forcing us to overcome the barriers to the decision jobs.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to people in power and producers of film and film and music, and people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a change lasting and meaningful.
We can also tell the courage of courage -- good, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, above all, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to do in front of what happened.
A few guys told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me like anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all I didn't believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned how to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, also discovered that if it was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and see that none of us is nothing that the world is about telling us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to do anything.
And in the other, I make the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I am a <unk> <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had a chance to have visited <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> to more than 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be fatal to a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than a half of a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposed to be even held by autism.
But a moment, it wasn't the article that sparked the argument about autism and the <unk> vaccines, and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Medical School.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world continue to find that vaccines will put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of the rise of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
A few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about her creating all their professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates continued to only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> of funds like <unk> <unk> is routinely routinely <unk> by autism as an epidemic as if he could make another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Centers for Disease Control what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and a better detection of <unk> to explain these degraded numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for their son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to figure out, why were they so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less than seeing with the slow progress and <unk> science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
Over the most part of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital -- in <unk> <unk> published a paper that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> private worlds <unk> people around, even their own parents.
They could amuse him during hours he was waving their hands on their faces, but they were prey to panic as when he didn't put his favorite toy on your favorite place without knowing it.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By the 1950s, as the main authority of the world on the subject, declared it less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as far as far as far as South Africa as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis was very <unk>
For example, <unk> to give that diagnosis to the <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he had been <unk> that he had nine out of 10 children sent up for other doctors to their doctor's office -- without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold and cold parents.
These kids, he said, have been held carefully in a refrigerator than not <unk>
At the same time, however, <unk> I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that we are taking in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the children in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records. He says, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents <unk> desperate to win their approval approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive psychologist, in London, thought the theory of mothers <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and his husband was <unk> warm and <unk> and had a very deep autistic child called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a child as no services of support, no special education, no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service, that they needed more resources for autistic kids, and their families, Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They did a study of prevalence of autism in the general population.
We had a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clearly the model of <unk> it was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse.
Some children couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by the astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the <unk> of the <unk>
So these kids didn't fit in nice <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost for trying to make sense of your data.
How did no one realized these kids had before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article in <unk> and then he was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that no one wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article from competition, but he avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation to the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was German, and he <unk> it for her.
The document offers a story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music, and the kids followed their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism by having autism by having described as disability as disability for life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, I called them their little teachers, and he got to help in the development of education methods that were especially right for them.
And <unk> related to saw autism as a diverse diverse continuum that spanned an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and the autistic traits were common and they've always been, watching this continuum in <unk> known in the pop culture as awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a bit of autism is essential.
I was able to see that <unk> found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as the parents were <unk>
In the next few years, they worked on silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and the early '90s, their changes came into <unk> by using the limited model of <unk> by a wide and peaceful model.
These changes didn't fall in broken broken up.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked backstage to reform these <unk> people around the world to see an autistic adult child for the first time.
Before he came out with <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism was about, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and fathers around the world knew what autism.
At the same time, the first easy medical test are introduced to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact hoped that it was, making people with autism and their families finally <unk> support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in <unk> a simple, powerful story and <unk> history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of prevention that one in 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that puzzles are for solving by the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition,
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and a deficit of attention to detail.
<unk> people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> who believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in understanding the teachers, employers with skills, community communities, and parents with faith in potential for their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on covered to the <unk> the <unk>
As we went to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to afford a brain.
Thank you.
